1
00:00:06,725 --> 00:00:08,725
大家好 我是 Saron Yitbarek
Hi everybody, I'm Saron Yitbarek

2
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:12,725
这里是红帽的原创播客节目《代码英雄》的特别番外篇
and this is a special bonus episode of Command Line Heroes,

3
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:14,725
这里是红帽的原创播客节目《代码英雄》的特别番外篇
an original podcast from Red Hat.

4
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:18,940
我们的节目在第 2 季去了很多地方
This podcast went a lot of places in Season 2.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,534
我们探索了编程语言、数据大爆炸、
we explored programming languages, data overload,

6
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:25,478
安全危机 以及无服务器时代的到来
security crises, the advent of serverless.

7
00:00:25,606 --> 00:00:28,401
我们甚至去了火星
I mean, we even went to Mars.

8
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:33,419
但是 在第 2 季结束之后 我们还有一个地方要去
But after closing out Season 2, there was still one more place we wanted to go.

9
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:37,935
我们要走进推广大使和思想领袖们的认识当中
We wanted to go inside the minds of the advocates and thought leaders

10
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:40,959
他们着手塑造了开发者工作的面貌
who help shape all the work that developers do.

11
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:44,220
有时 他们被称为"开发者推广大使"
Sometimes they're called developer advocates

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,736
或者说他们担任开发者关系的职位
or they're in developer relations

13
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:49,695
又有时 他们被称作开发者布道师
or they're developer evangelists.

14
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:52,900
从开发者的角度来看 无论他们的具体头衔是什么
Whatever their exact titles, from the developer's perspective,

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,618
他们似乎或多或少都在做相同的事情
they seem to do a lot of the same things.

16
00:00:55,938 --> 00:00:58,269
你在会议上见过他们发表主题演讲
You've seen them give keynotes at conferences.

17
00:00:58,397 --> 00:01:01,762
你在播客上听过他们接受采访 就像在本期节目中一样
You've heard them getting interviewed on podcasts, like this one.

18
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:04,146
你可能还阅读过他们的博文
You've probably read their blog posts.

19
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:05,865
但他们是谁呢？
But who are they,

20
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:09,956
他们发声 又能做到什么？
and what exactly are they using their voices to get done?

21
00:01:10,575 --> 00:01:16,290
为了迎接 2019 年 我们为大家召集了一次优秀人物的圆桌会议
To ring in 2019, we've pulled together a roundtable of amazing people for you.

22
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,941
尽管他们的头衔各不相同 但他们的目的是一致的
While their titles are all different, their purpose is the same.

23
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:25,464
他们的工作是帮助开发人员 并确保其声音和需求能被听到
They're here to help developers and make sure their needs and voices are heard.

24
00:01:25,848 --> 00:01:29,850
这些人都是典型的代码英雄
These folks are classic command line heroes.

25
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:33,500
出身于湾区
From the Bay Area,

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,202
Sandra Persing 是 Mozilla 的“全球策略师”
Sandra Persing is a Mozilla Global Strategist

27
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:38,070
也是 DevRel 峰会的创始人
and creator of the DevRel Summit.

28
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,357
嗨 Saron
Hi, Saron.

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,356
你好
Hello.

30
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:43,385
还有同样来自旧金山的 Ricky Robinett
And also in San Francisco we have Ricky Robinett.

31
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:46,665
他是 Twilio 的“开发者网络总监”
He's the Director of the Developer Network over at Twilio.

32
00:01:47,113 --> 00:01:47,750
怎么说？
What's up?

33
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,900
从凤凰城外和我一起来的是 Robyn Bergeron
Joining me from just outside of Phoenix is Robyn Bergeron,

34
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,900
红帽的社区架构师
a community architect at Red Hat.

35
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:56,075
嗨！你好吗？
Hi there. How are you?

36
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,000
我很好
I'm doing great.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,550
看到你真高兴
Excellent.

38
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,800
在不同的地方 这份工作的践行者被冠以不同的头衔
So there are a lot of titles floating around.

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,550
例如“开发者推广大使” “开发者布道师”、“开发者关系”
There's Developer Advocate, Developer Evangelist, Developer Relations,

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,324
对于新事物来说 基本定义非常重要
and with all these new things, basic definitions are super important.

41
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:10,425
因此 我认为 好的起点是
So, I think a good place to start is

42
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:12,950
先定义这些头衔
just to define what these things are

43
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,765
尤其是定义你可以在这个领域做什么
and specifically, what you all do in this space.

44
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,878
所以 你能告诉我你的头衔是什么 以及这个头衔的意思吗
So, can you tell me your job title and what that title actually means?

45
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:22,286
Ricky 你先来
Ricky, let's start with you.

46
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,460
好 听着不错
Okay, sounds good.

47
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:26,804
我的头衔是“开发者网络总监”
My title is the Director of the Developer Network.

48
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:28,250
我有幸供职于一个开发者关系专家团队
What I have the privilege of doing is

49
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,150
我有幸供职于一个开发者关系专家团队
serving a team of developer relations professionals.

50
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,612
我们有一个布道师团队
We have an evangelism team,

51
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,442
还有一个教育团队和一个社区团队
we have a education team and we have a community team.

52
00:02:36,442 --> 00:02:39,363
因此 这绝对是一个大杂烩
So, it's definitely a mishmash of all the different titles of you hear,

53
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:41,175
有你听说过的各种不同的头衔
So, it's definitely a mishmash of all the different titles of you hear,

54
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:42,647
我们将其汇集在这个团队之中
we kind of collect them on the team.

55
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,850
厉害啊 Sandra 你呢？
Awesome. And Sandra, what about you?

56
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:50,600
我在 Mozilla 担任“全球策略师” 负责管理活动和赞助
I am at Mozilla as the Global Strategist for events and sponsorship

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,068
我与 Mozilla 新兴技术小组的开发者拓展团队合作
and I work with our developer outreach team

58
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:56,786
我与 Mozilla 新兴技术小组的开发者拓展团队合作
in the emerging tech group at Mozilla.

59
00:02:56,786 --> 00:03:00,000
我通常会将我的日常活动解释为
I usually explain my day to day activities as

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,200
大量的研究、交流和探索
a lot of research and communications and explorations

61
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:08,120
在此之后 就是评估和做出决定
that really leads to evaluating and deciding,

62
00:03:08,248 --> 00:03:11,050
决定我们该怎样使用资源：
you know, how we should all invest our resources:

63
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,084
这包括时间 金钱 纪念品 扩音器之类的
our time, money, swag, speakers, et cetera,

64
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:17,700
来回馈开发者社区
in order to give back to the developer community,

65
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,075
同时也从开发者社区得到反馈
but also to receive feedback from the developer communities.

66
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,971
这份工作既有布道的一面 也有推广的一面
So both the evangelism side and the advocate side.

67
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:26,500
很棒 Robyn 该你了
Awesome. And Robyn, you're up next.

68
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,853
你好 好吧 我的正式头衔是“社区架构师”
Hi. Well so, my official title is Community Architect.

69
00:03:31,749 --> 00:03:33,670
人们就我这个头衔有过很多问题
I get a lot of questions about this title.

70
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,375
我曾被称为“社区经理”
I've gone by Community Manager.

71
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,085
也曾被称为“开发者推广大使”
I've gone by Developer Advocate.

72
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:40,429
我甚至还曾经做过“运维推广大使”
I've even gone by Operations Advocate at one job in the past.

73
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,370
但是我想 我做的是…嗯 你知道
But I like to think of what I do is, you know,

74
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:44,948
像是“社区经理”之类头衔
when you're a community manager,

75
00:03:44,948 --> 00:03:47,748
这种头衔像是在说 你负责管理社区里的人
like the idea that you're really managing all these people

76
00:03:47,748 --> 00:03:49,581
但他们其实都是自己好心来贡献的
who are contributing out of the goodness of their heart

77
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:51,648
这种说法 在某种意义上 有点蠢
is sort of a silly notion.

78
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,050
所以 我喜欢把我的工作当成是构建一个框架
So, I like to think of what I do as building frameworks

79
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,769
让人们可以顺利地参与其中
in which people can actually successfully participate

80
00:03:57,769 --> 00:03:59,538
确保过程中没有障碍
and make sure that roadblocks aren't in their way

81
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:02,300
并确保他们可以完成所有他们想要做的事情
and that they can get done all the things they want to get done.

82
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:07,400
Ricky 因为你基本上是在负责整个开发者网络
And Ricky, since you are essentially the Director of the entire network,

83
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,150
你不只是推广团队、布道团队或者社区团队的一员
you're not just in advocacy or evangelism or community,

84
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,378
你更像是在负责运行整个项目
it kind of feels like you're running the whole show.

85
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:15,914
你是怎样理解“推广”的任务的
How do you understand this idea of being an advocate

86
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:19,514
是为了开发者而推广 还是向开发者推广？
either for developers or advocating to developers?

87
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,626
这是个好问题
Yeah, that's a great question.

88
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:24,100
Phil Nash 是我们团队中的一名布道师
Phil Nash, who's one of the evangelists on our team

89
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,575
他对此有很好的认识 我要剽窃他的点子
had a great framing for this that I'm going to steal,

90
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:30,250
我们可以从很多不同的角度来解释这份工作
which is we have a lot of different ways of describing what we do,

91
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,769
但说到底 我们的工作其实就是帮助他人
but ultimately a lot of them just being help.

92
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,841
好 这个我喜欢
I like that. Yeah.

93
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:36,560
我们帮助开发人员
We help developers,

94
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,950
有时候这些帮助看起来就像是在 Stack Overflow 上回答问题
and so sometimes that help looks like answering a question on Stack Overflow.

95
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,495
有时看起来像是打造新工具
Sometimes it looks like building a new tool.

96
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:46,375
有时看起来像组织活动
Sometimes it looks like organizing an event

97
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:51,237
有时又像是对开发中的产品进行内部改动
and then sometimes it looks like initiating a product change internally.

98
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:54,128
因此 我认为这就是我所听说过的最好的看法
so, I think that's the best framing I've heard

99
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:57,024
我们负责提供帮助
is really our responsibility is to help.

100
00:04:57,653 --> 00:04:58,287
的确
Absolutely.

101
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,673
Sandra 你的职位让我感兴趣的一点是
Sandra, what I'm so interested in about your position

102
00:05:01,673 --> 00:05:04,861
你不光是个策略师 还是个“全球”策略师
is that you're not just a Strategist, you're a Global Strategist

103
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:07,805
让世界各地的开发人员组织起来
and you're all over the world trying to bring developers together

104
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:10,042
并且帮助他们 这是你在 Mozilla 的工作的一部分
and help them as part of your job at Mozilla.

105
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:15,796
在全球范围内 “推广”、“倡导”会是什么样的呢？
When we think about advocacy on a global scale, what does that look like?

106
00:05:15,796 --> 00:05:19,335
在不同的国家、不同的大洲之间 这份工作的含义会有所不同吗？
Does it mean something different across different countries, continents?

107
00:05:19,847 --> 00:05:21,270
当然有不同
Yeah, absolutely.

108
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:26,534
我们今年刚刚在新加坡举办了第三届 DevRel 年度峰会
We just wrapped our third annual DevRel Summit this year in Singapore

109
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:31,075
在前两年 我们是在西雅图举办的这项活动
and the past two years, we hosted the event in Seattle

110
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:33,000
而到了新加坡
and getting out to Singapore,

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,156
我们看到了不同的视角
we saw a different perspective.

112
00:05:35,156 --> 00:05:37,200
当我们走出湾区时
When we get outside of the Bay Area,

113
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,736
就连某些最基本的组织方式都需要做出改变
it can be something as basic as,

114
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:43,888
比如 在线下 如何保证一切运行如常
you know, how do we make sure everything just works offline,

115
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:46,016
连接性是个大问题
because connectivity is such an issue

116
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:48,925
再比如 我们该怎样才能
or something like how do we just make sure

117
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:54,957
使一名在印尼工作的开发者在峰会中与社区充分互动
a developer who's working in Indonesia feels just connected to a developer community,

118
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:58,478
无论他是线上参会 还是来到现场
whether that's online or onsite through meetups.

119
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:05,600
我们总会发现 所谓的“基础”
And always going back to recognizing that some of our quote unquote "basic things,"

120
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,134
一些我们看来稀松平常的事 比如在湾区简单开个会
some of our easy things like creating a simple meetup in the Bay Area,

121
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:11,175
这再常见不过了 对吧？
which is so a dime a dozen, right?

122
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:12,957
你高呼一声“我要参会” 就会发现到处都有聚会可以参加
You throw a rock and there's a meetup everywhere

123
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:15,607
这种情况在世界上其他地方并非常态
is still something really special

124
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,238
对于 比如说 越南的开发者来说
and something that a developer in let's say Vietnam

125
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:24,030
这种聚会可能对他们非常宝贵 非常重要
still sees to be incredibly important and valuable

126
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,670
能极大地丰富他们作为开发者的社区生活
and enriching their developer community life.

127
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:31,825
我发现 大家都以某种方式提到了社区
And one thing I'm noticing is that everyone has mentioned community in some way.

128
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,041
我自己也运营着一个社区
And I run a community myself.

129
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:37,950
它叫做 Code Newbie 然而我经常被一些公司招募
I do Code Newbie and I regularly get recruited by companies

130
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,254
作为他们的布道师或社区经理
to be an evangelist or a community manager for their company

131
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:45,400
有一件事 我一直都有点儿担心
and one thing that I've always been a little worried about,

132
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,149
一想到就会有点害怕
maybe a little squeamish about is thinking,

133
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:51,600
我在想 我花了三四年时间维持这个社区
okay, I've spent the last three, four years taking care of this community

134
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,709
不求回报地付出
with no strings attached,

135
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:55,256
从自己的角度看来 我已经尽我所能
on my terms,I'm doing what I think is best.

136
00:06:55,512 --> 00:06:57,275
但如果我为一家公司工作
But if I work for a company,

137
00:06:57,275 --> 00:06:59,884
我就必须要牺牲这些吗？
then will I have to sacrifice that?

138
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:01,323
我是否需要
Am I going to be in a position

139
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:04,175
将公司需求置于社区的需求之上？
where I have to put the company before the needs of the community

140
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,992
我该如何平衡这种关系呢？
and how do I balance that relationship?

141
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,900
所以我在想 Robyn
So I'm wondering, Robyn,

142
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,075
或许可以问问你这个“社区架构师”
maybe we could start with you as a Community Architect,

143
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:12,331
你是如何区分这两者的呢？
how do you separate that?

144
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,547
或者说 你是如何平衡这两者的？
How do you maintain that church and state relationship, so to speak?

145
00:07:16,507 --> 00:07:18,526
这种平衡确实值得深思熟虑
Well, it's certainly an interesting balance.

146
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:22,228
我想说 我以前担任过 Fedora 项目负责人
I mean, one of my former jobs was actually being the Fedora project leader.

147
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,353
你知道 Fedora 是 RHEL 的上游
And you know, Fedora is the upstream for Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

148
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:31,200
所以在这个职位上 寻找平衡就是工作的一部分
you know, part of your role there is really to be sort of the balancing act, right?

149
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,689
天平的一边是“社区的人们是否开心”
The balance between are people happy in the community,

150
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:37,649
另一边则是“公司是否对社区满意”
is the company happy with what the community is doing

151
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:40,943
要达到的效果是 每个人都是快乐大家庭的一员
and making sure that basically everybody's one big happy family.

152
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:46,125
你懂的 如果你在尽力做这种事
And you know, I think when you're doing your job best in that position

153
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:48,715
你基本上注定了要
yeah, you're pretty much bound to

154
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:54,171
时不时地激怒公司决策层的某些人
probably anger someone at the corporate headquarters once in a while.

155
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,368
但是你也知道 最终还是要用结果来证明 对吧？
But you know, the proof is in the pudding at the end of the day. Right?

156
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,750
人们总是问我 你是如何平衡
People ask me all the time like, how do you balance, you know,

157
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,325
Ansible 和红帽之间的关系的
what's going on with Ansible and Red Hat

158
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:05,440
你知道 当 Ansible 被红帽收购时
and you know, like when Ansible got bought by Red Hat,

159
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,503
大家的反应就像是 “老天 红帽会接管所有的决策吗”
like, oh my God, is Red Hat going to take it over

160
00:08:08,503 --> 00:08:12,125
"他们是不是要干什么坏事 比如取消 Ubuntu 支持之类的？"
and do something terrible to it like get rid of, Ubuntu support?

161
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,625
这完全跟整个项目的目的是背道而驰的
And it was like, that would be defeating the whole purpose

162
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,727
这完全跟整个项目的目的是背道而驰的
of having this entire project.

163
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:21,967
我们能有 4000 名贡献者 肯定不是因为我们的项目很糟糕
Like, we haven't gotten to 4,000 contributors by being terrible.

164
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:24,351
确保你的管理层信任你
Making sure that your management trusts in you

165
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:27,225
和员工之间要一直保持消息畅通
and that you have clear communication with folks all the time

166
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:28,900
知道当下发生了什么
about what's actually going on

167
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,594
避免意想不到的情况
and that there aren't surprises on either side of the aisle

168
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:37,666
这直接影响到你是会成功
is part of what makes the difference between success

169
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:41,650
还是 因为预想不足 而没办法保证成功
and maybe not always success, but certainly people being surprised.

170
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,874
嗯嗯 确实
Mm-hmm. Absolutely.

171
00:08:43,194 --> 00:08:44,202
Ricky 你呢？
And Ricky, what about you?

172
00:08:44,202 --> 00:08:45,775
你觉得该怎么处理“政教关系”
How do you think about church and state

173
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,652
如果你有那么多不同的职责的话？
in that relationship when you're doing so many different things?

174
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:54,225
我认为你必须相信公司和技术
I think you have to believe in the company and the technology.

175
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:58,529
你必须相信 你所带给开发人员的东西
You have to believe that what you are bringing to developers

176
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:02,757
将会对他们的生活、职业生涯和他们的公司产生影响
is going to have an impact on their lives and their careers and their companies.

177
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:04,606
在另一方面
And then on the flip side,

178
00:09:04,606 --> 00:09:10,350
你得让高管们对你的工作方式和理念有信心
you have to have executives who believe in this approach to your work.

179
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,252
在这方面我们很幸运 我们的 CEO 自己就是开发者
So, we're very lucky that our CEO is a developer

180
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:17,099
在很多方面
and in many ways

181
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:22,004
他是我们和开发者社区打交道的原动力
was the driving force behind the way that we approach our developer community.

182
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,637
布道师的使命之一是激励开发者 并给他们以工具
Our evangelists have a mission to inspire and equip developers.

183
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,625
因此 有时我们会讨论
And so, there are times when we say,

184
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,733
像这样能起到激励的效果吗？能把装备推广给他们吗？
is this going to inspire and equip them?

185
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:32,603
起不到这种作用的事 我们就不去做
Because if it's not, we shouldn't really be doing it

186
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:35,946
因为这不是我们职责的一部分
because it's something that's outside of our purview.

187
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:40,040
Sandra 我觉得你有点儿优势
Sandra, I feel like you're a little bit at an advantage

188
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,664
因为 Mozilla 是非营利性的 对吧？所以我觉得 -
because Mozilla's a nonprofit, right? So I feel like maybe -

189
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:45,702
我刚想说呢
I was going to say.

190
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:46,812
跟我讲讲这个吧
Tell me about that.

191
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:50,117
我们 Mozilla 在历史上就是一家叛逆的公司
The history of Mozilla is that we're a rebellious company.

192
00:09:50,117 --> 00:09:54,856
我们一直在反抗大企业 对吧
we've always rebelled against the corporate man, right?

193
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:57,426
我们源自于网景
The whole history of coming out of Netscape

194
00:09:57,426 --> 00:10:00,477
我们的创始人之一是 Mitchell Baker
and with one of our founders, Mitchell Baker,

195
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:06,950
而我们的理想 是“确保互联网对每个人都是开放的免费资源”
in making sure that the web is and the Internet is an open and free resource for all.

196
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,375
我是说 直到现在 我们每个人
I mean, we still, every one of us,

197
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,679
Mozilla 的每个人都仍对这句格言深信不疑
every Mozillian believes this mantra and we hold it dear to our heart.

198
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:22,079
所以这家公司 很奇妙地 百分百地向社区侧倾斜
So it's absolutely an amazing company that has embraced the community side 100%.

199
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,854
Ricky 我还清楚地记得那件红色的运动夹克
So Ricky, I vividly remember the red, like, sports jacket
注：红色夹克是 Twilio 的一种内部奖励
发放给编写应用程序之后在全公司面前完成程序演示的员工

200
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:31,070
我还记得你亲自出马做的演示 你讲得棒极了
and I remember seeing you personally onstage doing these awesome demos
注：红色夹克是 Twilio 的一种内部奖励
发放给编写应用程序之后在全公司面前完成程序演示的员工

201
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:34,275
我感觉这种方式
it feels like that whole approach to

202
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:38,350
作为联系并帮助开发人员的方式 它非常新颖
connecting with developers and helping developers was very new.

203
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,756
你们 Twilio 的人是怎么想到这个主意的？
Where did that idea even come from at Twilio?

204
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,024
你这么说实在是过誉了
Well, that's very kind of you to say.

205
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:48,370
据我们所知 我们其实是站在巨人的肩膀上
We do really believe we stand on the shoulders of giants here.

206
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,400
比如说苹果的盖伊·川崎
You think of Guy Kawasaki with Apple,

207
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,850
在我们之前 早就有人用这种方式做营销了
of people doing this style of marketing way before us.

208
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,700
我们只是非常幸运
I think that we got to be fortunate enough

209
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,225
能在正确的时机把它带到开发者面前
to be at the right time to take this to developers.

210
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:07,118
很多人响应了召唤
And there's just so many people who came in

211
00:11:07,118 --> 00:11:13,662
他们带来了解决问题的许多办法 以及不断进步的方式
with the idea of how we can do this and how to keep leveling up how we approached it.

212
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:17,350
不过我真不知道红色运动夹克是谁的主意
I don't actually know who invented the red track jacket though,

213
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,800
现在我得去探寻历史了
so now I need to go find the history

214
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,606
现在我得去探寻历史了
so now I need to go find the history
You gotta find that out.
你一定得找到答案

215
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:20,575
搞明白这是从哪里开始的
of where that started.

216
00:11:20,575 --> 00:11:21,498
那是件很棒的夹克
That's a great jacket.

217
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:25,038
我知道 今天下午我的任务就是这个了
I know. That's my mission for this afternoon now.

218
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,625
我想知道 布道和推广的想法
And I'm wondering how has that idea of evangelism, and advocacy,

219
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,975
在 Twilio 是如何随着时间而发生变化的
how has that changed over time at Twilio,

220
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:34,325
考虑到你们
given the fact that, you know,

221
00:11:34,325 --> 00:11:37,600
曾经只是一家创业公司 一家叛逆的初创公司
at one point you were a small little startup or a little rebellious startup,

222
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,363
现如今 你们成了一家大公司
and then now you're kind of a big company.

223
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:45,371
随着公司本身的变化 布道的形式又是如何变化的呢？
How is the shape of evangelism changed as the company itself has changed?

224
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:52,675
刚开始 我感觉我整一年 每一天都在参加黑客马拉松
Yeah, when I started here, I feel like I could have spent 365 days a year at hackathons
黑客马拉松（Hackathon）：又译为编程马拉松、黑客松 又称为黑客节（Hackfest）
是一种限时的活动 开发者与团队聚在一起 在限定的时间内完成开发 常见的时限从24小时到一周不等

225
00:11:52,675 --> 00:11:57,125
在纽约 每周末你都得从五六个这种活动中选一个
and in New York every weekend you had to pick from five or six hackathons.

226
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:02,325
我们当初布道几乎都是在黑客马拉松活动上
So much of what we did with evangelism was the hackathon scene

227
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:04,753
而现在 场景不同了
and now, that's not the same scene.

228
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:11,362
最大的变化来自于公司外部而不是内部
Really, the biggest changes have been driven outside the company rather than inside.

229
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,300
我之前谈到布道师的任务 激励开发者 给他们以装备
So I talk about evangelists inspiring and equipping.

230
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,044
好的一方面在于 就算过了这些年 这点也没变
And so the nice thing is that hasn't changed in all the years,

231
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:22,012
达成任务的方式不断地在改变
so the ways that they inspire and equip keep going differently,

232
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:25,740
但使命本身并无任何变化
but the mission itself doesn't change.

233
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:29,660
那么 Robyn 随着 DevOps 和 DevSecOps 的兴起
And Robyn, with the rise of DevOps and DevSecOps,

234
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:35,100
你个人是怎么看待“推广”的？作为社区架构师 你又怎么看待？
what does advocacy look like for you and for being that community architect?

235
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,998
会有运维推广大使吗？
Is there gonna be a Ops advocate?

236
00:12:38,702 --> 00:12:40,522
呃 运维推广大使其实是…
Well, actually that was ...

237
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:45,025
我辍学之后的第一份工作
I mean, my first job after dropping out of school,

238
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,312
我不推荐这样 孩子们 别在家干这个
don't recommend it, kids. Don't do that at home.

239
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:47,824
Stay in school.
留在学校里继续上学

240
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:49,550
听好了 我看着你呢 小姑娘
Listening. Look at looking at you, daughter.

241
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:54,875
我最开始其实是在摩托罗拉当系统管理员 当了有一些年头
My first job was actually as a SysAdmin at Motorola for a number of years

242
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:59,355
然后去当了 Fedora 的负责人 之后
and when I moved on from being in charge of Fedora,

243
00:12:59,355 --> 00:13:02,220
跳槽去 Elastic Search 干了一段时间
I worked at Elastic Search for a while and you know,

244
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,392
那时候我的头衔是开发者推广大使
had this title of Developer Advocate and was like,

245
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,300
虽然我在大学里跟 C 语言搏斗了好几个学期
yeah, so I hacked my way through several semesters of C in college.

246
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,875
但是我的心一直都在运维这边
But my heart was always in operations.

247
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:14,525
我开始觉得 我真的是开发者推广大使吗？
I started feeling like am I really a developer advocate?

248
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:18,200
我感觉我怎么一直都在跟运维推广呢
I feel like I'm just advocating to ops folks mostly.

249
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,275
那之后我就开始自称“运维推广大使”
And I just started calling myself an operations advocate

250
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:22,350
没人对我这个叫法有过什么特别的反应
which nobody blinked an eye at.

251
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:24,425
所有人都只是说 “哦 这头衔还挺有意思”
Everyone said, well, that's a really cool title.

252
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:26,800
我其实 你懂的 我只是在做推广
I'm like, you know, I'm just advocating in general

253
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,252
大部分时候是向公司内部 告诉大家其他人都在做什么
mostly to the inside of my company about what everybody else is doing.

254
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:37,600
Sandra 我们之前聊到 “推广”和“布道”的任务
So Sandra, we talked about how advocacy and evangelism

255
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,684
在世界各地的不同面貌
looks different in different parts of the world,

256
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:42,098
我想知道 这些年以来
but I'm wondering over the years

257
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:45,534
随着我们变得越来越全球化 联系越来越紧密
as we become increasingly more global and more connected,

258
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:51,998
“布道”这份任务的整体形象 对你来说有改变过吗
has the larger picture, the larger shape of evangelism shifted over time for you?

259
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,762
你知道什么是"开发者关系"吗？
You know, what is developer relations?

260
00:13:54,762 --> 00:13:57,916
我们展示产品的样子 像不像干推销的？
Are we pitching our product being more salesy?

261
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,789
你知道的 我也发现
You know, and I notice that

262
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:03,500
就算是大公司也不喜欢用这种推销式的策略了
even large corporations are moving away from that tactic.

263
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:08,684
要知道 保持真诚 用一片真心
Understanding that being authentic, being truly mindful

264
00:14:08,684 --> 00:14:15,875
倾听开发者的需求 并给出回馈 这才是一切的关键
of listening and responding to the needs of developers is key above all else,

265
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,225
推销产品没办法让你成功
not pitching product.

266
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:20,662
我总会跟在 Mozilla 的团队分享一个理念
I always go back and share with my team at Mozilla

267
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:26,275
开发者是最聪明 最有创造力的客户群体
that developers are actually one of the smartest and creative customer base

268
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:27,975
至少我们要打交道的客户里是这样
that we'll ever work with.

269
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:32,455
他们大老远就能闻出来你说的话是不是放狗屁
They can smell that BS from miles away.

270
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:36,900
我们必须明智地选择放出信息的方式
So, we have to be smart about how we are sharing information,

271
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:42,350
要开动聪明才智 各尽所能
like it has to be a diverse group of talented and intelligent minds

272
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,300
一齐发挥创造力
all coming together to become creative

273
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,600
要像这样与开发者社区交流
in our approach of communicating to our developer community.

274
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,425
这个我喜欢
Oh, I really like that.

275
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:53,975
需要将许多不同的技能
I like this idea of many different skill sets,

276
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:58,150
还有背景 结合在一起 才能更好地服务开发者
I guess, backgrounds need to come together to really serve developers well

277
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,902
并帮助开发者自助
and to help developers help themselves, too.

278
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:04,275
当我回顾开发者推广大使的兴起时
When I think about the rise of developer advocates,

279
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:08,575
在我看来 它与开源的兴起息息相关
to me it feels very connected to the rise of open source.

280
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:12,750
感觉像是 开源贡献者越来越多
It almost feels like the more open source contributors there were

281
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,612
开源变得越来越重要
and the bigger deal open source became

282
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:18,428
大公司越来越看重它
and the more big companies took it seriously,

283
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:20,925
他们就不得不去
they almost had to

284
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:24,825
跟开源贡献者 跟开发者搞好关系
establish better relationships with these open source contributors, these developers,

285
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:26,975
这两者在我看来 关系很大
and it feels like those two are really connected to me.

286
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:30,150
我很好奇你们的看法
So I'm curious about your ideas about that.

287
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,875
Robyn 从你开始吧
So Robyn, let's start with you.

288
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:32,975
我的观察是正确的吗？
Is that true at all?

289
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:36,815
“推广大使”的这个想法与开源的兴起有所联系吗？
Is that idea of advocacy connected at all to the rise of open source?

290
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:40,207
如果你是一家卖软件的公司
If you are a company who is selling software

291
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,700
或者卖许可证 或者靠长期支持赚钱
that or selling whatever licenses, long termsupport,

292
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,269
无论一家开源公司采用怎么样的业务模式
you know, whatever your open source company's business model actually is,

293
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:50,125
如果你们无法得到反馈 并以此调整自身
if you don't have that feedback loop

294
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,493
或者你没有真正关注人们在说什么
or you're not actually paying attention to what people are saying,

295
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:56,625
你就会做出一看就有问题的东西
you're going to wind up delivering the proverbial wrong thing.

296
00:15:56,625 --> 00:16:00,143
眼观六面耳听八方
And really being able to encompass that, you know, around the world

297
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:02,085
和自我孤立闭门造车
and just day to day in what you do

298
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:07,125
就是成功 和“做出有问题的作品” 之间的区别
is the difference between success and I guess making the wrong thing,

299
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,725
不会有人想浪费时间在后者上面
which nobody wants to spend time doing.

300
00:16:08,725 --> 00:16:09,749
这是个坏主意
That's a bad idea.

301
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:11,487
这种一般都是坏主意
Yeah, that's generally a bad idea.

302
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,750
我想知道你们每个人
So, I want to know from each of you

303
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,622
各自都在关注什么 都在思考什么
what you all have been focusing on, really thinking about.

304
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,850
Ricky 先从你开始
So Ricky, let's start with you.

305
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,225
你想通过在Twilio的角色
What kind of improvements do you try to bring about

306
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:26,849
为开发者文化带来什么进步？
in the developer culture in your role at Twilio?

307
00:16:27,617 --> 00:16:33,087
如果要让我说在跟开发者聊天的时候 最经常听到的一句话
If I were to say the phrase I've heard the most when I talk to developers,

308
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:35,775
那会是“我不是开发者 但是…”
it's, "I'm not a developer, but,"

309
00:16:35,903 --> 00:16:41,425
我心里总是挂着的 最重要的事之一 恐怕就是这件了
and that's probably one of the biggest things that's always on my mind

310
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:43,825
把开发者的定义拓宽
is broadening the definition of developer.

311
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,000
对我们来说 冒牌者症候群极为常见
Imposter syndrome for so many of us is a very real thing.

312
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:55,739
奇妙的是 就算是你认识的某些最优秀的开发者 也会有这种毛病
It's just amazing how even some of the best developers you know are struggling with it.

313
00:16:56,123 --> 00:17:00,895
对我来说 这就是我们能对文化做的最重要的改变之一
And for me, that's one of the biggest things we can all do in our culture

314
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:05,263
那就是允许一个人说 “你知道吗？我是个开发者”
is give people permission to say, "You know what? I am a developer.

315
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,375
“我写代码解决问题”
I am solving problems with code."

316
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,150
我最爱的故事之一 是
And so, one of my favorite stories is

317
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,094
在我们社区里 有个魔术师 他叫 Doug McKenziethat
we have a member of our community named Doug McKenziethat's a magician.

318
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:21,975
他自学了 PHP 好在魔术表演中使用科技
And he taught himself PHP so he could use tech in his magic tricks.

319
00:17:22,423 --> 00:17:23,225
喔 那不错
Oh, neat.

320
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:27,175
Doug 是个很酷的人 因为他超级谦虚 他总是说
Doug is so cool because he was super humble about like,

321
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:28,610
“我不是开发者”
"Oh, I'm not a developer."

322
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,975
但你哪天就会发现
And suddenly you see, like,

323
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:34,226
他写的代码非常复杂 很多人可能一辈子都没见过这样的代码
he's writing more complicated code than many people have ever seen,

324
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:36,210
这些代码能做到令人震惊的事情
to do things that blow minds.

325
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,250
因此 我感觉世界上有许多 Doug McKenzies 这样的人
And so, I just feel like there's so many Doug McKenzies in the world

326
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,089
他们都在用代码做着伟大的事情
who are doing great things with code

327
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:48,200
我们有机会让他们成为社区的一份子
and we have the opportunity to give them permission to be part of the community

328
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,312
并获得与这些成就相匹配的身份
and to have an identity in that work.

329
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:51,975
我喜欢这个故事
I love that story

330
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:55,066
它让我想起我曾经为 Code Newbie 播客采访过的一个人
because it reminds me of someone I interviewed for the Code Newbie podcast actually,

331
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:59,114
她是一名作家 有很多写作任务
and she was a writer and she had a bunch of assignments

332
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,644
必须学习 Git 才能撰写有关 Git 的文章
where she had to learn Git in order to write about Git

333
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,209
她写了很多这方面的文章 又逐渐转向了其他的编程主题
and she'd written so many of these articles and it grew to be on other coding topics

334
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:10,450
最终 几年过去之后
and eventually, you know, a couple of years had passed

335
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,502
她成了一名开发者而不自知
and she'd essentially become a developer and didn't know it.

336
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:15,550
在我采访她的时候 我说
And by the time I interviewed her and I said,

337
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,059
“嗨 你知道自己是个开发者吗”
"Hey, do you know that you're a developer?"

338
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:18,009
她说：“不 我是个作家 ”
She's like, "No, I'm a writer."

339
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:22,269
我说 “你也可以两个都是 这两者并不互斥”
And I said, "You can be both. They're not mutually exclusive."

340
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,871
但话说回来 让人换个角度说
But yeah, that shift in perspective of saying,

341
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:29,095
“我写代码 我造软件 所以我能自称是个写代码的”
"Hey, I'm actually coding and creating, therefore I can now call myself a coder,"

342
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,775
这可不容易 要让人脑筋转过这个弯 可得费些时间
it's tough for people. It takes a while to get there.

343
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:33,100
是啊 的确
Yeah, absolutely.

344
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,575
对
Yeah.

345
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:35,375
Robyn 对你而言
So Robyn, for you,

346
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:40,639
你这几年中 带来的最积极的变化是什么？
what's been the most positive change that you've managed to push forward in recent years?

347
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:46,175
那就是 保证我们在扩张规模时不会失去方向
Just making sure that as we grow, that we're not losing track of the big picture,

348
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:50,881
我们的目标主要有几个 首先是让产品易于使用
that our main goals around keeping it simple for people to use,

349
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:52,963
其次是让项目易于贡献
simple for people to contribute to,

350
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:56,955
让它能解决实际生活中的问题
simple to actually get stuff done within your life,

351
00:18:56,955 --> 00:18:58,925
很大一部分的工作 都是保证我们不偏离这些目标
making sure we're not losing track of that

352
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,725
还有一部分工作是争取工程上的帮助
or getting more engineering help

353
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:04,850
请人来帮忙管理项目结构
to just work on some of the structure of the actual project

354
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,917
保证一切都井井有条
and make sure that we're doing a good job of keeping all that stuff in order

355
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:10,522
我不清楚啊 我觉得这些都很重要
was, I don't know, I thought that was important.

356
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:13,628
我应该没办法因为这个拿诺贝尔和平奖
I don't know that I'm going to win a Nobel Peace Prize for that,

357
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:18,475
但我知道这些对许多贡献者都非常重要
but I know it's something that mattered a lot to lots of the contributors.

358
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,125
说得通
That works for me.

359
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:21,425
Sandra 你呢
Sandra, what about you?

360
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:24,001
这些年中 你作为全球策略师 带来的最积极的变化是什么？
What's been the most positive change that you've managed to push forward

361
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:26,001
这些年中 你作为全球策略师 带来的最积极的变化是什么？
in recent years as a Global Strategist?

362
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,125
我能立即想到两件事
Two things that really stand out from my mind is

363
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:33,040
其一是 拓展“开发者”这个词的定义 让开发者的人物形象多样化
expanding this definition, the persona of developer,

364
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,487
这件事非常重要
has been something that's been very important.

365
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:38,650
我们想扩张社区 对吧？
We'd love to grow our community, right?

366
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,700
那为什么要把开发者的定义和形象限制死呢？
So why restrict the definition and description of a developer?

367
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:46,375
我们在 Sundance 举办过一次座谈会 来的都是些名人
When we did a panel at Sundance with some famous names

368
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,050
Reggie Watts 和 Chris Milk 之类
like Reggie Watts and Chris Milk,

369
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:54,350
我们给了电影制作者、制片人、决策者一个机会
we gave an opportunity for filmmakers, producers, decision makers to say,

370
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,025
让他们能说“这个我们也能做
to say, "Oh, we can do that, too.

371
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:59,575
我们不必被‘电影制作者’的身份框住”
We don't have to be bound by restrictions

372
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:03,150
我们不必被‘电影制作者’的身份框住”
of what can we do as creative filmmakers."

373
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,387
“我们能使用技术 成为开发者
We can adopt technology, and we too can become developers,

374
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:10,791
这是非常耳目一新的体验”
and that was very refreshing to see.

375
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:16,439
另一次 我们在 Mozilla 和一位艺术家合作
Another moment that we had at Mozilla was bringing an artist,

376
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:18,987
他叫 Ian Brill 来自芝加哥 是灯光师
Ian Brill, a light artist in Chicago,

377
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:22,625
我们一起做的项目叫做“拱门”
to work with us on a project that we label Arch,

378
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:22,650
我们用塑料做了个巨大的、带 LED 灯、能发光的结构

379
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,975
我们用塑料做了个巨大的、带 LED 灯、能发光的结构
and we brought this huge plastic light, LED light,

380
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:30,575
用 7 个树莓派编程控制
with seven Raspberry Pis being programmed structure,

381
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:35,025
然后把它带到两个重要的 JavaScript 开发者活动上
to two significant JavaScript developer events this year.

382
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:39,012
为了吸引更多的编程者
And in order to invite more programmers,

383
00:20:39,012 --> 00:20:41,227
就算他们不自称开发者也行
whether they call themselves developers or not,

384
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:46,300
让他们尝试 Mozilla 今年大力倡导的两种编程语言
to try out two languages that Mozilla was advocating this year pretty strongly,

385
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,950
WebAssembly 和 Rust
WebAssembly and Rust.

386
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,646
我们简单制作了两种模板 鼓励他们“来试试看”
So we created two simple templates, to say, "Try it out,"

387
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:56,475
但我们想推动的不是编程本身
but it's not programming that we wanted to push towards.

388
00:20:56,475 --> 00:20:57,409
不是“写代码”这件事
It's not coding.

389
00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:59,985
而是“这里有几行代码
It was, "Yes, there's some lines of code.

390
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:02,775
这是编程语言 但你会想要
It's language, but what you want to do is

391
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:06,119
能把自己写出的代码 转化为艺术”
create a few lines that now can translate into art,"

392
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:10,350
这让许多新人进到了我们的群体之中
and that brought so many new people into our fold,

393
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,417
他们真的到了我们的桌子前面
literally brought them to our table,

394
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:14,561
等到他们写了代码
and then they would write their lines of code,

395
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:16,950
去拱门下走一趟
go and walk over under the Arch,

396
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,640
就能看到他们写的灯光表演在整个结构上循环播放
to see their light expressions now being looped in the structure.

397
00:21:21,075 --> 00:21:22,025
真妙啊
That was amazing.

398
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:24,800
这真棒 这实在是太美了
Wow. That sounds beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

399
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:29,450
所以 我想 我们有提到“为开发者做推广”
So, I'm wondering, when we talk about advocating for developers,

400
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,000
也谈到了一大堆社区的事
and we talked a ton about community,

401
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,171
说到底 “推广”和“布道”的重点在于
and this idea of at the end of the day,

402
00:21:33,171 --> 00:21:36,967
无论我们的职位头衔是什么 我们的使命都是帮助他人
whatever our job titles are, we're really just trying to help people,

403
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:40,700
我想知道 开发者需要怎样的帮助？
what do developers need help with?

404
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,745
Ricky 从你开始
Ricky, let's start with you.

405
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:44,241
开发者们都向你求助过什么？
What do developers say that they need from you?

406
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,825
喔 这是个好问题
Wow. Yeah, that is a good question.

407
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:51,875
我们发现 有这么一回事
I think that one of the things that we've found is that,

408
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,082
科技变化得实在太快
like technology's changing so quickly,

409
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:58,234
我们很多时候被问到的问题就是
and a lot of what we get asked about is just,

410
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:03,333
“我从哪里开始？我首先要做什么？我怎么知道我走的路是正确的呢？”
"Where do I start? What do I do first? How do I know I'm on the right path?"

411
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:09,273
这可能是我们投入最多的领域之一
For us, that's probably one of the areas we have been investing the most,

412
00:22:09,273 --> 00:22:13,175
我们一般管这个叫做 帮助人们发现
is we call it like helping people discover

413
00:22:13,175 --> 00:22:15,150
他们用代码改变世界的能力
their power to change the world with code.

414
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,775
很美妙 我赞成
Oh, that's beautiful. I approve.

415
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,700
谢谢 对 这很棒
Well, thank you. Yes. That's exciting.

416
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,108
为了这个 我们做了一款叫做 Twilio Quest 的工具
So we built a tool called TwilioQuest,

417
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:25,950
帮助人们发掘他们的力量
to help people discover that power,

418
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,675
让他们知道 该怎么开始
to help them know where to get started,

419
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:34,500
不过我感觉 你知道 很多人一直在寻找自己的身份
but I just sense, you know, there's been this theme of people finding their identity,

420
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:37,549
或者 等着谁来批准他们获得身份
or getting permission to have that identity,

421
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:40,725
有很多写代码的人
and for every person that's writing code already,

422
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:43,749
或者说 用代码和软件解决问题的人
or solving problems with code or software,

423
00:22:43,975 --> 00:22:47,975
但更多的人只是想要学会这项技能 却不知道如何开始
there's so many more who want to, and just don't know where to start yet.

424
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:50,800
我们对这件事非常上心
So that's a thing that's on our mind a lot.

425
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:51,950
确实
Yeah.

426
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:52,725
So Robyn, for you at Red Hat, what are Red Hat developers looking for?

427
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:58,995
Robyn 从你和红帽公司的角度 红帽的开发者都想要什么呢
So Robyn, for you at Red Hat, what are Red Hat developers looking for?

428
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:03,050
情况经常是 有人找上你的时候
A lot of times, it's people who come to you

429
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,025
他们多半是遇到了什么障碍
and they've got some roadblock in their way,

430
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:06,925
有时候是 你知道
whether it's, you know,

431
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:10,357
“机器人没注意到我的 PR” 之类的
"Somehow my PR fell through the robot cracks,"

432
00:23:10,484 --> 00:23:12,650
很多时候不是这样 他们遇到的困难可能是类似于
but a lot of times, it's also people who are like,

433
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,903
“嗨 我有个主意 我觉得很酷
"Hey, I had this cool idea.

434
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:16,550
它可能不太适合这里
Maybe it doesn't quite fit in here,

435
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,975
不过我觉得 它可能对社区运行有帮助
but I thought maybe it might improve how the community is running,

436
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:25,559
或者 说不定跟我们做的项目很配 我该怎么办？
or might be a good companion tool to other stuff that we're working on. What do I do?"

437
00:23:25,815 --> 00:23:28,485
这时候 任务就变成了 “我该怎么帮你入门呢？”
And it's like, "Well, you know, how can I help you get started,"

438
00:23:28,915 --> 00:23:32,500
你懂吧？“我该怎么帮你？你是需要被批准么？”
you know? "What can I do? Like, do you just need someone to say yes?"

439
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,780
我的全职工作就是开绿灯 基本上 你不管做什么都可以
Because I am here to say yes all day long, to basically anything,

440
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,124
让大家知道 你当然有权去做你想做的事”
and just let people know that yes, of course you have permission to do that,"

441
00:23:39,124 --> 00:23:44,245
你懂的 我觉得 在我这个位置上能做到的 最棒的一件事
so that's, you know, I think the best thing that you can do, at least in my position,

442
00:23:44,245 --> 00:23:46,975
就是保证大家前路畅通
is make sure people don't have things in their way,

443
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:51,425
如果他们需要被批准才能前进的话
or if the one thing that's in their way is waiting for someone to just say yes,

444
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:53,648
我一直重申 你不需要批准
I keep reiterating all the time that you don't need permission,

445
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:56,775
不过 如果有人需要批准 看在上帝的份上 那就准了他们吧
but if someone needs it, then by god, give it to them.

446
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,975
我们要结束了 这是最后一个问题
So, the last question, we need to wrap things up,

447
00:24:00,975 --> 00:24:02,403
这个问题是问给你们每个人的
so I'm going to ask you each something.

448
00:24:02,595 --> 00:24:08,709
在即将到来的 2019 年 你想要推广的 最重要的东西是什么
What is the single-most important thing that you're going to be advocating for in 2019?

449
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:12,483
如果你有魔杖 你想用魔法做出什么重大改变？
If you had a magic wand, what's the next big thing you'd want to change?

450
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:13,904
Sandra 从你开始吧
Sandra, let's start with you.

451
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:16,050
我就知道你会问这个
Oh, I knew you were going to do that.

452
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:22,210
我们2019年会面临的最大挑战
Well, the biggest challenges, and yet the most exciting projects

453
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,361
也是我们最激动人心的项目
that we're going to be working on for 2019,

454
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,058
是让我们的承诺真正兑现
is to truly deliver on our promise of

455
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:34,690
让互联网成为最好的 最大的 最易于使用的平台之一
the web being one of the greatest, biggest, most accessible platform.

456
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:41,047
我们总是鼓励开发者 为互联网开发 这样软件就能随地部署
We always tell developers it's where you should build, and deploy everywhere,

457
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:47,075
但我们知道 互联网本身非常复杂
but knowing that the web itself is incredibly complex,

458
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:50,225
有许多个浏览器供应商
and that we have multiple browser vendors out there,

459
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:51,950
我们说的话 有时候并不切合实际
sometimes that's not a true statement,

460
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:55,650
这是一项长期的挑战
and it's been a perennial challenge for us,

461
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,050
尤其对我们 Mozilla 而言
especially at Mozilla,

462
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,449
我们希望能让互联网开放、自由 让所有人都能使用
where we want to keep the web open, and free, and accessible for all.

463
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:03,625
我们希望能坚定不移地
We want to continue to make sure that

464
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:06,125
继续为开发者们兑现我们的承诺
we are fulfilling that promise to our developers,

465
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:10,350
让互联网的确开放、自由、人人可用
that the web is indeed open, accessible, and available to all.

466
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,125
爱了
Oh, love that.

467
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:12,348
Ricky 你呢
Ricky, what about you?

468
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:15,025
确保我们继续为开发者服务
Just making sure we're serving developers

469
00:25:15,025 --> 00:25:18,689
不管他们在线上聚会 还是在线下集会 不管他们身处何方
where they gather, online and offline, throughout the entire world.

470
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:22,750
人很容易就会只记得他们能看到的东西
It can be super easy to get focused on what you see

471
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,440
然后忘记 其实开发者无处不在 就算你看不到他们
and forget that there's developers everywhere, even when you don't see them.

472
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:32,925
我要挥一挥魔杖 到世界各地去
So, I would wave my magic wand and just be more places all over the world,

473
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,325
找出能帮助那里的开发者的办法
finding out how we can help developers there.

474
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:40,225
我得说 我非常喜欢Jerod的一个说法：“暗物质开发者”
I just want to say, I loved Jarod's talk about dark matter developers.

475
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:41,571
这个概念非常的厉害
It was incredible.

476
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,750
你第一次听说的时候 会觉得 这个说法实在是绝妙
It's like such an amazing concept when you hear it for the first time.

477
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,284
你会觉得 “我去 还真是这么回事”
It's like, "Wow, that really is a thing."

478
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:52,057
说说看吧 什么是“暗物质开发者”呢
So tell us about that. What's a dark matter developer?

479
00:25:52,441 --> 00:25:54,500
这就是说 有这么一些开发者
Essentially, there are developers out there,

480
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,705
他们不参加聚会
there are those who do not show up to your meetups,

481
00:25:56,705 --> 00:26:01,200
他们不上 Github
who do not participate in GitHub,

482
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,075
不参与线上社区 不贡献Stack Overflow
online communities, do not contribute to Stack Overflow.

483
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:08,250
但他们是开发者 他们也在努力工作 做出贡献
Those are the developers who are still actively working and contributing,

484
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,375
但我们不知道
but we do not know.

485
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,625
我们知道他们存在 但我们看不见他们
We know that they're there, but we cannot see them.

486
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:13,963
我们不认识他们
We cannot identify them,

487
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:18,450
然而 他们在开发者的社区中 是很重要的一部分
and those are actually a very important segment of the developer community

488
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,107
也是经常遭到无视的一部分
that we tend to ignore,

489
00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:21,103
我们不能继续无视了
and we cannot.

490
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:24,025
忽略那些不愿发表意见的社区 会损害我们与开发者的关系
It will be to our detriment working in developer relations,

491
00:26:24,025 --> 00:26:27,334
忽略那些不愿发表意见的社区 会损害我们与开发者的关系
to ignore the community that does not speak up,

492
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:29,765
我们需要更积极主动地
and we need to be more proactive

493
00:26:29,925 --> 00:26:33,825
寻找宇宙中的暗物质开发者
in searching those dark matter developers out in our universe.

494
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,193
我喜欢 - 这个太酷了
Oh, I love ... Oh, that's very cool.

495
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:38,278
是啊 Jarod在Twilio工作 对吧？
Yeah, and Jarod actually works at Twilio, right?

496
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:41,905
是的 是的 他负责运营亚太区的 DevRel
Yes. Yes, he runs the APAC DevRel.

497
00:26:42,575 --> 00:26:44,463
我从前在红帽的同事之一
One of my former Red Hat colleagues,

498
00:26:44,463 --> 00:26:47,600
Chris Grams 现在在一家名为 Tidelift 的公司工作
who's now at a company called Tidelift, Chris Grams,

499
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,648
他写过一篇博客 标题是“暗物质很重要”
actually used to have a blog that was titled Dark Matter Matters,
注：此处标题是双关 亦可译为“暗物质也是物质”

500
00:26:51,968 --> 00:26:52,757
这就像是
because it's sort of the -

501
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,075
你知道 你所看不到的东西其实仍然很重要 所以
You know, the things you don't see still actually matter, so -

502
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,373
Robin 你呢？
And Robyn, what about you.

503
00:27:00,373 --> 00:27:02,421
你会用魔杖做什么呢？
What would you do with your magic wand?

504
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,999
有魔杖的话 能做好多事啊
Oh, with my magic wand, so many things,

505
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,947
但是 跟这次谈话最相关的是
but I guess pursuant to this conversation,

506
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,795
更好地管理各个社区之间的依赖关系
getting better at managing our dependencies upon each other,

507
00:27:11,795 --> 00:27:13,459
不给人带来 “惊吓”
and maybe not surprising each other,

508
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:14,715
尤其是 我们中间还有那么多人
especially when so many of us

509
00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:19,575
在OpenStack 在OPNFV 在Ansible工作
work in OpenStack, and OPNFV, and Ansible,

510
00:27:19,575 --> 00:27:22,327
这些项目都是彼此依赖的
and all of these things that build on top of each other.

511
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:27,847
在不同的项目之间 建立更清晰的关系
Just making sure that the relationships between our projects is more obvious

512
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:31,300
而不是埋头工作 把这些统统无视
than things can be when you're head-down in stuff.

513
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:35,288
这是我期待明年能达成的事
So that's a thing I'm really looking forward to over the coming year,

514
00:27:35,288 --> 00:27:38,975
我们现在有做事的动力 大家情绪都很高昂
because we're getting traction on stuff. It's very exciting right now.

515
00:27:38,975 --> 00:27:40,703
有动力总是件好事
Traction is always just so good.

516
00:27:40,703 --> 00:27:41,471
太叫人兴奋了
It's so exciting.

517
00:27:42,431 --> 00:27:44,340
我想向大家道谢 非常 非常的感谢你们
Well, I want to thank all of you so, so much

518
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,700
来到这里 分享你们的所思所想 和你们的故事
for joining us today and sharing your minds, and your thoughts, and your stories.

519
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,581
非常感谢！各位来道别吧？
Thank you all so much. You want to say goodbye?

520
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:51,875
大家再见
Bye, y'all.

521
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,050
真不错 Saron 我很感谢
Nice. Thank you so much, Saron.

522
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,050
很高兴能参加这次座谈
It's been a pleasure being on this panel.

523
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,325
对 感谢你请我们来
Yes. Thanks, thanks for having us.

524
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:00,004
是啊
Absolutely.

525
00:28:01,053 --> 00:28:05,613
今天的圆桌会议包括红帽的社区架构师 Robyn Bergeron
Today's roundtable included Robyn Bergeron, Community Architect at Red Hat,

526
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:08,253
Mozilla 的全球策略师 Sandra Persing
Sandra Persing, Global Strategist at Mozilla,

527
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:12,198
以及 Twilio 的开发者网络总监 Ricky Robinet
and Ricky Robinet, Director of the Developer Network at Twilio.

528
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:17,582
我认为自己很幸运
I consider myself hugely lucky

529
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:22,830
能有这样的平台让我分享 对于社区将何去何从的愿景
to have platforms where I get to share my vision for what our community could become,

530
00:28:23,214 --> 00:28:25,799
无论是这档播客节目 还是在其他地方
whether here on this podcast or elsewhere,

531
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:25,978
无论是这档播客节目 还是在其他地方

532
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:32,391
但我想要指出 你无需拥有自己的播客就能够成为推广大使
but I want to point out, you do not have to have your own podcast to be an advocate.

533
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:36,308
成为推广大使只须睁大眼睛 并为他人发声
Being an advocate simply means you keep your eyes open

534
00:28:36,308 --> 00:28:38,804
成为推广大使只须睁大眼睛 并为他人发声
and you speak up on behalf of others.

535
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:42,147
每个人都能胜任这份工作
It really can be everybody's job.

536
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,359
我希望 Robyn、 Sandra 和 Ricky
So I'm hoping Robyn, Sandra, and Ricky

537
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,663
他们的谈话能对你有所启发 让你看到“推广”对你而言的意义
give you a little inspiration to advocate for matters to you.

538
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:55,247
同时 《代码英雄》第 3 季已经在制作中了
Meanwhile, Season 3of Command Line Heroes is already in the works.

539
