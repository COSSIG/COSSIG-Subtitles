*起床声*

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,740
天啊 我又做了那个噩梦
Oh, man. I had that nightmare again.

9
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,700
在梦里 我有一些很棒的想法
The one where I've got these amazing ideas,

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,920
但我不能上手开发
but I can't develop them

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,160
因为没有相应的开源技术可以使用
because there's no open source tech to work with.

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,080
我认为一个没有开源的世界几乎注定是邪恶的
I think a world without open source is almost bound to be evil.

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,290
我想 如果软件在 20 世纪 80 年代遭到闭源
If software had been closed in the 1980s and
（LCTT 译注：这里的软件指 MINIX）

14
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,110
而源代码再也没有被开源过
and the source code had never been opened up again,

15
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,040
肯定会少很多创新
I think that there'd be a lot less innovation for sure.

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,500
那将是一个落后的世界
It would be a backward world.

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,270
*BGM~*

18
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,300
我认为智能冰箱肯定会变得更少
I think there'd certainly be less smart refrigerators.

*BGM*

20
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,800
*在一个没有智能冰箱的世界中*
*In a world without smart refrigerators.*

*BGM*

22
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,100
好吧 好吧 你懂的
Okay, okay. You get the point.

23
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,100
我们正在想象一个没有开放源代码技术的世界
We're imagining a world without open source technology,

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,800
这并不特别美好
and it's not very appealing.

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,800
想象一下：
So picture it.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
它们无处不在
Gatekeepers at every part of the road.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,390
于开发者而言
For us developers,

28
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,200
没有开源的世界
a world without open source

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,200
意味着更少的自由和影响力
would mean far less freedom—and influence.

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,330
*BGM*

31
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:22,080
在整整一季中 我们一直在纪录开发人员在开源世界中的角色
All season long, we've been tracking the role of developers in an open source world.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,980
随着开源技术与工具的不断涌现
Our work has been evolving and expanding

33
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:30,310
我们的工作也不断演进和扩展
with the growth of the open source tools and techniques that make our work possible.

34
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,460
无论是敏捷宣言 DevOps 的兴起 还是容器编排
Whether it's the Agile Manifesto, the rise of DevOps, or container orchestration,

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,460
我们宣称的力量和自由
the power and freedom

36
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,000
都与开源哲学紧密相关
is tied to that philosophy of open source.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,220
在本季的最后一集
In our season finale,

38
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,090
我们将会回顾前几集中的内容
we're taking a step back and looking at how far we've come.

39
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,610
随着世界走向开源
As the world goes open source,

40
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,230
这个词的原始含义能剩下多少呢？
how true to the original meaning of that term can we remain?

41
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,230
而我们 接下来 则将何去何从
And where are we headed next?

42
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,670

*BGM*

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,590
没有开源的世界不是我想要的世界
A world without open source is not a world that I would want to live in,

49
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:24,000
也不是绝大多数人想在其中生活的世界
nor do I think that it is a world that the vast majority of people out there would want to live in.

50
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,070
这位是史蒂文·沃恩-尼科尔斯
This is Steven Vaughan-Nichols.

51
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,070
你可能在第一集和第二集里
You might remember him from Episodes 1 and 2

52
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,720
谈论操作系统战争的时候记住了他
when we were talking about the OS wars.

53
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,060
他是哥伦比亚广播集团互动媒体公司的特约编辑
He's a contributing editor at CBS Interactive

54
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,900
从快速调制解调器的速度还是 300 比特每秒时以来 他就一直关注着科技
and he's been following tech since 300 bits per second was a fast modem.

55
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,000
除了 Linux 之外你可能无法叫出任何一个开源程序的名字
You may not be able to name a single open source program other than Linux,

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,100
但是你当前的生活是建立在开源之上的
but you're current life is a life built on open source.

57
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,360
如果不使用开源技术 绝大多数人甚至无法上网
Most of us can't really go online without using open source tech.

58
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,450
开源技术几乎存在于地球上的每台超级计算机中
 It's in almost every supercomputer on the planet.

59
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,400
它运行在物联网物联网（IoT）中
It's running the Internet of Things.

60
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,130
它存在于你的手机、你的 Web 服务器，你的社交媒体
It's in your phone, your web server, your social media,

61
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,900
以及 大型强子对撞机中
and oh yeah, it's running the Large Hadron Collider, too.

62
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,200
并非只有我们开发者从中受益
And we developers aren't the only ones who've figured out the benefits of this stuff.

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,400
开源态度现在已经超越了技术的范畴
Open source attitudes are now spreading beyond technology

64
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,000
影响了其它行业 例如经济学、音乐、科学和新闻业
to influence other industries like economics, music, science, journalism.

65
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,930
如果建筑师
What if an architect

66
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,910
以我们分享代码的同样方式
shared the blueprint for a building

67
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,160
分享建筑的蓝图
in the same way we share code?

68
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,660
如果一个记者打开她的档案
What if a reporter opened up her files

69
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,290
让任何人不仅可以检查她发表的文章
and let anyone scrutinize not just her published article,

70
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,290
还能检查她的研究和采访记录
but her research and interview notes?

71
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,000
我们不应为此而惊讶
It shouldn't surprise us,

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,900
因为开发人员培育这份哲学已有多年
the philosophy that developers have been nurturing for years.

73
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,730
每个人都可以
he idea that everyone gets to

74
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,560
看到代码、注释代码、复制代码、提供补丁
see and comment on the code, copy it, offer fixes,

75
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,280
这实际上是一件非常基础的事情，对吧？
it's actually a pretty fundamental thing, right?

76
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,500
这就是共享
It's sharing.

77
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,280
自最早的人类分享食谱以来
Ever since the earliest humans were sharing recipes for meals,

78
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,820
我们就知道公开分享指令集
we've known that openly sharing sets of instructions,

79
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,700
或者说算法 对人类是净收益
algorithms in other words, has a net benefit for humanity.

80
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,900
在某些方面
In some ways,

81
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,190
开源技术现在能使我们重温这个基本事实
open source technologies are now allowing us to get back to that basic truth.

82
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,230
我认为 使更多的事物开源
I think that more things being open source kind of facilitates

83
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:22,150
会促进和鼓励人们查阅原始资源 这总是很好的
and encourages people to go back and consult primary sources, which is always good.

84
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,740
这位是 Hannah Cushman
That's Hannah Cushman,

85
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,780
她是 DataMade 的一位开发人员
 she's a developer at DataMade,

86
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,780
他们一直在努力使城市变得更加开放
where they've been trying to make our cities more open.

87
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,520
将来自政府的大量公开数据进行整理并合理地处理
Reams of open data from governments get compiled and made sensible

88
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,940
就可以让普通市民使用它来采取行动
so ordinary citizens can actually use it and take action.

89
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,000
他们使用的技术是开源的
The tech they use is open source,

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,430
同时他们对政治的态度也是如此
but so is their attitude about politics.

91
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,960
我们在芝加哥与一个叫做 City Bureau 的组织
We did a project here in Chicago with a organization called City Bureau

92
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,080
进行了一个项目 和他们一起为公立学校测试铅含量
where we were working with them to get at lead test results for the public schools.

93
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,900
我们测试了这些学校中几乎全部的供水设备
So, the Chicago public schools went through and tested,

94
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:08,470
这些全部公布的测试结果
if not all, a significant portion of the water fixtures in all of their school and published the results of those tests

95
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,530
有 500 份 PDF 文件之多
as a series of more than 500 PDFs.

96
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,690
是的 这太好了
So, that's great.

97
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,400
但这并不完全是一种使数据公开的有效方式 
But it's not exactly an effective way of making data open.

98
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,470
在整个系统中 
It was really difficult to see

99
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,960
很难看到例如哪里发现了铅 以及哪里的铅含量更高 
where lead was found across the system and, like, higher numbers.

100
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,740
我们使用了另一个叫做 Tablua 的开源工具 
We used another open source tool called Tablua,

101
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,660
可以在终端上运行 
which you can run from your terminal,

102
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,790
它能从 500 多个 PDF 文件中 
to extract data from over 500 PDFs

103
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,600
提取数据并将其放在一起
and put it all together

104
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,400
帮助我们把海量的信息 
and help put this huge dump of information

105
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,100
转储到一个对人们有用的上下文中 
into a context that was useful for people.

106
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,960
我认为查询源数据是一种非常有效的方式 
I think being able to consult that source data is a really powerful way

107
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,860
这使人们可以了解信息的来源
for people to kind of understand where information is coming from

108
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,000
并验证其正确性
and verify that it is, in fact, correct.

109
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,800
市民可以访问健康报告的详细信息
Citizens can access the details of health reports,

110
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,200
获取游说者的数据
data on lobbyists,

111
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,200
还可以查看城市政治的整个组织结构
they get to look at the whole engine of city politics,

112
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,500
DataMade 为此提供了浏览门户
and DataMade opens the hood.

113
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,210
这使芝加哥人有更多机会
That means the people of Chicago have a better chance

114
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,400
对市政的方方面面依民愿作出改变
of bringing about the changes they want to see.

115
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,590
加州州立理工大学的研究软件工程师 Carol Willing 认为
Carol Willing, a research software engineer over at Cal Poly,

116
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,360
这种不断扩展的开源态度
thinks that this expanding open source attitude

117
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,360
将给世界带来更广泛的变化
is the start of something much larger.

118
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,000
就个人而言 我认为开源将从开源软件发展到
Personally, I think that we're gonna evolve beyond open source software

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,720
开放硬件、开放政府、
to open hardware, to open government,

120
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,900
开放教育、开放协作、开放创新等等
to open education, open collaboration, innovation,

121
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,800
开源会不断进化
 so I think it's gonna continue to evolve.

122
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,120
现在 开源逐渐变得更像是自然法则
Open source is starting to look more like a law of nature

123
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,800
而不仅仅是科技界的产物
than just some outgrowth of the tech world.

124
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,230
人们慷慨奉献自己时间的事迹古而有之
People have been charitable and giving of their time freely for thousands of years,

125
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,200
但令人耳目一新的是
so that's nothing new.

126
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:03,430
开源深刻地改变了世界
But what is new about open source and has changed the world profoundly

127
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:09,000
因为它使不同的小群体联合起来
is the ability for groups to work together

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,560
一起致力于他们中任何一组都无法单独处理的大型项目
to build something bigger than what they could build on their own.

129
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,300
“用全新的技术来践行古老的理念”——
I love this idea!

130
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,600
这个主意我喜欢!
Taking some very new tech and using it to get back to some very old ideals.

131
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,800
但先别急着高兴
But before we get too excited,

132
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,470
随着开源这个词被越来越广泛地使用
 definitions can get wobbly

133
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,500
它的定义可能会变得模糊
as more and more folks start calling themselves open source.

134
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,600
在某些场合下
It starts meaning something that's

135
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
它开始意味着“免费” 或者“众包”
just free, or something that's crowdsourced,

136
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,000
甚至仅仅是“可定制”
or even just something that's customizable.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,600
例如
For example,

138
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,900
如果我只是允许你选择在冰淇淋上哪撒些糖粉
if I let you choose what kind of sprinkles go on your ice cream,

139
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,400
这不代表我的冰淇淋是开源甜点
that's not necessarily an open source dessert.

140
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,000
但是 如果我告诉你如何制作糖粉
 But if I show you how to make your own sprinkles,

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,680
让你改进我的糖粉配方——
let you improve on my sprinkle recipe,

142
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,100
然后 如果你也想与他人分享糖粉制作的秘密
and then give you my blessing if you wanted to share that secret with others,

143
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,100
那么 恭喜你 我们得到了一些美味的开源 
now that's some tasty open source right there.

144
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,400
那么 开源的原始定义又是什么？
So, what was that original definition again?

145
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,430
它很简单 但我们应当恪守
It's pretty simple, but we should keep repeating it.

146
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,350
要实现真正的开源
To be truly open source,

147
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,700
你需要公开代码
you need code,

148
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,080
或者蓝图 或者你的菜谱
or a blueprint, or a recipe.

149
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,210
换句话说
In other words,

150
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,190
就是使任何人都可以随意研究、
some kind of raw data that anyone can study,

151
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,350
修改和重新分发原始数据
change, and redistribute at will.

152
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,860
这种哲学将带来变革
It's a philosophy that's just starting to revolutionize the world

153
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,500
不过对于命令行外的世界 一切才刚刚开始
beyond our command lines.

154
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:37,790
*BGM*

155
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:42,250
这是一种非常惊人的技术开发方式
It's a really phenomenal way to do technology,

156
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,250
无论是它的成功
and I'm thrilled to death that is has been as successful

157
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,070
还是我已经参与其中的这一事实 都让我感到震惊
as it has been and that I've gotten to be a part of it.

158
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,070
Thomas Cameron
Thomas Cameron has been involved in open source

159
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,070
在 1998 年“开源”这个词被发明之前就一直从事开源工作。
since before the term was coined in 1998.

160
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,560
今天 他是 Red Hat 的高级首席云推广人员
Today, he's senior principal cloud evangelist at Red Hat.

161
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,040
他完全有资格谈论开源在如今的进展
He's perfectly positioned to talk about how far open source has come,

162
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,040
以及其发展的过程中发究竟生了多少斗争
but also how many battles were fought along the way.

163
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,440
你知道 经理们不想承担风险
Man there is huge pushback, you know, managers didn't want to take on the risk

164
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,000
这是巨大的阻力 因为它是免费的
because, well, it's free;

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,270
所以他们会想 “我没办法打电话寻求技术支持”
there's no one that I can pick up the phone and call for support;

166
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,270
“我不得不依靠特定的开源软件”之类
I have to depend on you.

167
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,750
这一类斗争还算简单
But we won a lot of these sort-of-easy fights,

168
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,390
在部门服务器、群组服务器、
the departmental servers or divisional servers

169
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,350
小型 Web 服务器、小型文件服务器和打印服务器上
or a small web server, a small file and print server,

170
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,200
随着时间的推移，我们打了不少胜仗
and over time after winning these easier fights,

171
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,240
更艰难的战斗出现了
the tougher ones came along.

172
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,200
在每次“作战”中 你会发现
And with every single one of those, you saw

173
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,000
系统管理员和系统工程师对开源越来越着迷
sysadmins and systems engineers become more enamored of open source.

174
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,810
长风破浪会有时 直挂云帆济沧海
Despite these battles, you couldn't deny the ongoing progress.

175
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,210
我目睹了开源给 IT 行业带来的改变
I have been able to watch open source transform the IT industry,

176
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,580
它最开始时用在
and it’s gone from

177
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,660
某些系统管理员办公桌下私搭乱建的服务器里
that rogue server that some sysadmin had under his desk

178
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:04,360
并最终传播到家喻户晓的大公司之中——英特尔、IBM、AMD
to huge companies with household names—Intel, IBM, AMD,

179
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,710
哎 你懂的 
you know,

180
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:12,000
每个你能想到的组织都开始为开源项目做出贡献
every organization you can imagine has started contributing to open source projects.

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,650
这绝对是一场斗争
And it was absolutely a fight,

182
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:21,040
我在不同的企业职位上都参加过如此多的相关争论
there were so many arguments I had at various enterprise positions that I held

183
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,540
我曾说过
where I said,

184
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:27,000
“我们需要把 Linux或其他开源技术引入数据中心”
"You know, we need to introduce Linux® or other open source technologies into the datacenter."

185
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,600
Thomas 观察到 开源软件开发正逐步占据市场
Thomas sees that open source software development is taking over.

186
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,350
但对于某些人来说 这很令人不安
But for some people, that's pretty unsettling.

187
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,290
我们能够分享信息与分析结果
We're able to share information and analysis,

188
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:44,880
这让那些一直占有信息并从中牟利的人感到害怕
and so that scares folks who historically have been the ones to hold information and derive value from it,

189
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,100
这种模式使他们无法轻易获取利润
whether it's charging money

190
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,420
也难以哪怕得到对一个组织的完全控制
or just having control of an organization,

191
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,200
这是巨大的变化 随之而来的是恐惧
it's a huge change and with that comes fear.

192
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,500
我们在本季开始时描述的支持开源的反叛者们
The open source rebels that we described at the start of the season

193
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,310
正领导着这个行业 
have now become industry leaders.

194
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,600
但从更长远的角度来看 故事绝不会在这里结束
But that's not the end of the story, not by a long shot.

195
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,700
Christopher Tozzi 是Fixate IO的高级编辑 
Christopher Tozzi is the senior editor at Fixate IO.

196
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:15,250
他将开源带来的颠覆视为某种根本性转变的开始
He sees open source disruption as the start of a fundamental shift in the way people everywhere,

197
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,250
这种转变将使世界各地的人们都能协同合作 - 而不仅是在软件开发行业中
not just software, are going to work together.

198
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,740
我认为 在过去的二十年里 开源变得如此强大的原因之一
I think that one of the things that has made open source so powerful over the last two decades

199
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,000
就是人们对去中心化一直保有兴趣 
is this continued interest in decentralization.

200
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,270
我认为，这也解释了开源如何影响其它技术创新
I think this also speaks to how open source has influenced other technological innovations.

201
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:38,420
比如 区块链也建立在这样的思想上：
Things like blockchain, which is also founded centrally on the ideas that databases,

202
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:44,580
如果我们摆脱集中的生产方式
or example, or transactions could be more efficient or could be more secure if they're decentralized,

203
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,060
去中心化的数据库或交易方式可能会更高效、更安全
 if we get away from centralized modes of production.

204
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,290
重申一次 我认为今天的开源 
And again, open source I think today,

205
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,730
自从 Torvalds 出现以来
ever since Torvalds came along,

206
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,100
就与开发工作的去中心化息息相关
had been about decentralization of development in labor basically.

207
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,710
全面的分权
That decentralization across the board

208
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,610
意味着整个世界都在走向开源
means the whole world's going open source.

209
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,200
体现了这一理念的开发人员 
The developers who embody that philosophy,

210
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,150
他们是最能想象未来的人
 they're the ones who have the best shot at imagining that future.

211
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,010
这是 Tristram Oaten
Here's Tristram Oaten,

212
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,100
他是伦敦的一位开发者
he's a developer based in London,

213
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
他肯定在考虑这场漫长的比赛
 and he's definitely thinking about that long game.

214
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:22,100
就像是3D打印机将通过在家生产零件来使我们的生活更轻松
It looks like 3D printers are going to make our lives easier

215
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,280
而且多半能更环保一样
and hopefully more ecologically sound by producing parts at home.

216
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,890
无论什么时候有东西坏了 你都可以在家里新制造一个
Whenever something breaks, you can just make it at home.

217
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:33,310
这是星际迷航式的未来的复制器 
It's the ideal Star Trek replicator future

218
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,710
就和理想中一模一样
that we were promised so very long ago.

219
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:40,500
这样 说不定 整座房子都能变得开源了
Hopefully, that will come into play so that entire houses can perhaps be open source.

220
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,020
Tristram设想了一个世界
Tristram imagines a world

221
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,100
在这个世界上，开源是各个领域都遵守的规则
where open source is the rule of the land

222
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,660
这意味着
and that means developers become,

223
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,660
开发者即使不是大师 至少也会成为人们的向导
if not gurus, then at least guides.

224
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,660
这种向导是至关重要的 
Really critical guides.

225
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,710
在未来 我们作为开发人员的角色将越加重要
In the future, our role as developers is going to become increasingly more and more important,

226
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,650
我们会变得越来越像“魔法师” 
and it's going to get increasingly more and more like wizards

227
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,000
如果我们现在还不够像的话 
if it isn't already.

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
好吧 魔法师 
Okay, wizards.

229
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,320
我们会成为魔法师 
We'll be wizards.

230
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,300
我们能用奇怪的语言驱使机器做奇妙的事 
We speak strange languages that make these machines do wonderful things,

231
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,410
于是 我们会被高薪雇来做宫廷魔法师
and we're paid a lot of money to be the court wizard,

232
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,600
或者公司魔法师
or the company wizard.

233
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,870
每个人的身体中都有设备
 And when there are devices in everyone's bodies and when there are devices everywhere

234
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,810
并且无处不在的设备都可以通过互联网访问
that are internet-accessible

235
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,760
还能被远程控制时 
and can be remote-controlled,

236
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,960
我们则需要作为一个团体
it's going to be very important that we as a group,

237
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,140
一个行会 以最好的信念行事
as a guild, act in best faith,

238
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:41,060
就像医疗行业要有不伤害他人的宪章等等 这非常重要
that the medical profession has a charter to do no harm and so forth.

239
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,310
我认为 开发人员需要共同决定
I think that as developers, we need to collectively decide

240
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,840
不要制造杀手机器人
that we're not going to build the killer robots,

241
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,600
也不要在每个人的路由器和每个人的助听器中
we're not going to build spying software

242
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,600
安置间谍软件
 into everyone's router and everybody's hearing aides.

243
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,600
我们需要彼此确认 
We need to assure each other,

244
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,190
并向所有人保证 
and assure everyone,

245
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,300
我们将为更大的利益而努力 
that we're going to work for the greater good,

246
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,200
而非为了伤害人类 
and not against humanity.

247
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,360
*BGM*

248
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,000
让我们现在保证不会造机器人杀手 对吧？
Let's all just promise right now that we won't build killer robots,

249
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,210
好
Okay.

250
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,000
在此之上 我确实认为 Tristram 说得对
And beyond that, I do think Tristram's on to something.

251
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,310
在某些方面
In some ways,

252
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,800
我们开发者已经看到了未来 
we developers have seen the future

253
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,900
这代表我们有机会在塑造未来上出一份力
and that means we've got a chance to help shape it.

254
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,900
10 年后 开源开发的道德标准将会是什么样子的？
What are the ethics of open source development going to look like in 10 years?

255
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,900
我们现在有着极大的特权 
We're in a supremely privileged position,

256
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,100
因此 我们有责任做正确的事
and it's up to us to do the right thing.

257
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,350
*BGM*

258
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,350
那么魔法师们 我们将去向何方？
 So, wizards, where are we heading?

259
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,000
我们能为开源创造一个健康的未来吗？
Can we conjure up a healthy future for open source?

260
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,200
我想和一个对这一切进行了深入思考的人谈谈 
I wanted to talk with someone who's done some deep thinking about all of this,

261
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,400
于是 我找到了这一位
 and I found her.

262
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Safia Abdall 是一名软件工程师
 Safia Abdalla is a software engineer

263
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,300
她一直在为交互计划做开源贡献
who's been making open source contributions to the Interact Project.

264
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,910
我们将会讨论 
We started imagining

265
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,030
真正的、可持续的、广泛的开源世界 
what a real, sustainable, broad-reaching open source world

266
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,000
会是什么样子
could look like.

267
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
听听看 
 Have a listen.

268
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,310
在你心里未来的开源会是怎么样的？
When you think about the future of open source and what that looks like,

269
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,310
和现在有什么不同之处？ 
what are some differences we might see?

270
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,780
嗯我想 我所看到的最大的新兴趋势之一
Yeah, so I think one of the biggest emerging trends

271
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,980
就是对开源可持续性的高度关注 
that I'm seeing is a lot of focus on open source sustainability,

272
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,200
我认为在该领域已经有了许多有趣的进展
 And I think there's been a lot of interesting progress in that space.

273
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,970
*BGM*

274
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,000
我们的工作能够得到多少改善？
how much better could our work become?

275
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,600
又会发生多少变化
How much would change?

276
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,800
如果我们能够建立她所描述的可持续发展的方法 
If we could build that sustainable approach she's describing,

277
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,300
如果公司能够贡献时间、代码和资源，我们的工作能够得到多少改善？
if corporations were contributing time, code, and resources.

278
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,690
所以我问她 
So I asked her,

279
00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:01,490
这样可持续的方式会给我们所创造的产品 
how do you see that impacting that actual products we create

280
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,210
和我们建构的工具 带来怎么样的改变？
and the tools that we build?

281
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,110
可悲的现实是 
The sad reality is that

282
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:13,310
当你没有精力 时间和金钱来为每个人打造好东西时 
when you don't have the focus and time and energy and money to build something well for everyone,

283
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,080
你就会倾向于只为自己做好它 
 what you tend to do is just build it well for yourself.

284
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,250
嗯 确实
Mm-hmm (affirmative), absolutely.

285
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,820
因此我相信开放源码模型 才能延长其生命周期
So I believe that if we discover more sustainable model for open source,

286
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,040
那么我们实际上将开始构建
 we're actually gonna start building software that's accessible to individuals

287
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,100
可供盲人、听障者或以其它方式残障的个人使用的软件
who might be blind, or hard of hearing, or disabled in other ways.

288
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,500
有趣 我喜欢
Interesting, yeah I really like that.

289
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:45,200
考虑到开放源代码的原则、流程、文化和社区
So, when you think about how the principles and processes and culture and community

290
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,000
以及你提到的所有这些内容
and all those things you mentioned of

291
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,010
该如何适用于技术之外、软件开发之外的行业时
open source might be applied to industries outside of technology, outside of software development,

292
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:58,310
你认为真正可以从开源中受益的领域是哪些？
what are some fields that you think could really benefit from open source,

293
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,750
你认为接下来开源可能会出现在哪里？
and where do you think open source might show up next?

294
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,540
喔 这是个有趣的角度
Oh that's a really interesting observation.

295
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:10,890
我第一个想到的是，开源思维可以被用于科学界
The immediate answer that comes to me is an open source mindset in the science community

296
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,300
使科学变得更加开放
and open science.

297
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,300
之所以我会想到这一点是因为
I think the realization is that

298
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,560
当你以开放方式分享软件时
when you share software in an open fashion,

299
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,740
你所分享的并不是一行行的代码
what you're sharing is not the literal lines of code,

300
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,220
好吧你确实在分享代码
well that is what you're sharing,

301
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,220
但更重要的是
but the other thing that you're sharing on top of that

302
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,700
你在分享知识和细节 在与其他人交流该如何做事
is knowledge and details about how to do something.

303
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,410
因此你真正分享的是知识
So what you're really sharing is knowledge.

304
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,680
开源的方式可以相当直接地应用于科学界
That translates really directly to the scientific world

305
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,560
因为研究人员也会花费大量的时间来探究特定课题
where researchers will spend a lot of time exploring a particular topic

306
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,700
随后就此课题发表论文
and then publish a research paper on it.

307
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,780
而且我认为我们需要向科学界倡议更加开放的科研方式
And I think focusing on an open science initiative

308
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,050
以确保科研成果能够对所有人开放
that makes sure that researchers are producing work that is accessible to all people,

309
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,250
以确保科研成果能够对所有人开放，使所有人都能理解、分享和参与
understandable by all people, and shareable and extendable by all people

310
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,470
这将会提高社会对科学的理解
is gonna improve society's understanding of science

311
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,340
并在一定程度上促进科学研究本身
and how far we can push research forward.

312
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,720
当我上大学时 我从事生物化学研究
When I was in college, I did biochemistry research

313
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:16,300
我非常习惯于带着热情进行实验、研究、尝试新事物
and I was very much used to this passion for experimenting, for researching, for trying new things,

314
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,220
然而同时 你也不能让人随意插手研究
but at the same time still being very protective over your discoveries

315
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,160
因为你需要称为通讯作者
because you need to be a published author. 
（注：存在学术流氓！）

316
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,750
你需要信誉
You need credit,

317
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,700
这是学术界进步的一个很重要、很重要的组成部分
You need credit, that is a huge, huge part of moving up in academia.

318
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,790
因此，开源的原则
So, when we're talking about bringing these open source principles

319
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:40,600
即分享原始数据、贡献劳动以及将未完成的产品公之于众
of sharing and contributing and putting out unfinished products out there and hoping other people will fill it in,

320
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,800
依靠集体智慧将其完工的这些原则
how do you see those principles possibly

321
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,210
和某些更具保护意识的行业必然发生冲突
colliding in other industries

322
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,240
你如何看待这种冲突？
where people might be more protective?

323
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:55,400
这是个好问题 我认为这涉及一个更大、更复杂的问题
Yeah, that's a great question, and I think that touches on a way hairier, bigger problem.

324
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,210
为了成功地将开源引入其他行业
For open source to be successful,

325
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:05,400
外在的动机和鼓励在很大程度上是必要的
the motivations and the incentives have to be,

326
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:16,630
你不能依赖于鼓励人们只专注于自己的目标的现有体系
You can't rely on systems that encourage people to focus on their own goals and motivations at the expense of others,

327
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,630
因为那样会牺牲他人的利益和社会的更大利好
and at the expense of the greater good of society.

328
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,590
我认为我们必须根本地改变我们看待很多事情的方式
I think at a fundamental level, we have to restructure the way we see a lot of things

329
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:32,800
并更改许多体系的运作方式 
and the way a lot of systems work to have them focus on

330
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,870
很难撤销像终身教职这样对大学有很多负面影响的制度
It's hard to do, it's hard to undo systems, like tenure, which have a lot of negative repercussions at universities.

331
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:52,400
很难消除其它可能损害生态、损害他人 或者阻碍社会进步的激励机制
It's hard to undo other incentive systems that can harm the planet, can harm other people, can harm progress as a society.

332
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,400
 不管是采用开源的思维方式
But starting to adopt an open source mindset

333
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,200
还是主动取消这些体系
and taking the initiative to begin to undo those systems

334
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,820
我们都有极长的路要走
will go a long way.
(注：害人之心不可有，防人之心不可无: l)

335
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,900
确实
Absolutely,

336
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:10,610
如果你可以从头重新创造开源
so if you could recreate open source in its entirety from scratch,

337
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,700
那么 属于你的开源版本又会是什么样的？
what would your version of open source look like?

338
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,060
哇噻 *来自Abdalla的奸笑~*

339
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,740
关于开源 我要改变的第一件事
The first thing that I would change about open source

340
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,020
是它的公共关系和形象
is its public relations and its image.

341
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:29,600
我可能会尝试建立一种开源文化或社区
I would probably attempt to build an open source culture or community

342
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,050
让人们认识到
that didn't issue that perception

343
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:38,320
你即使不是精英 或者精湛的开发人员 也能活跃并取得成功
that you had to be elite or a fantastic developer in order to thrive and succeed,

344
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,840
现有开源文化中的精英倾向使我感到震慑
and that was one of the biggest things that deterred me.

345
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,700
另外 我也要重点关注开源的可持续性
The other big thing I would focus on is open source sustainability,

346
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,040
增加公司的责任感和开源体系的健康程度
increasing corporate accountability and the health of open source systems.

347
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,140
我认为很多人没有意识到的事情之一是
I think one of the things that a lot of people don't realize

348
00:20:52,140 --> 00:21:02,410
许多受欢迎的技术公司和平台都包含了开源要素
is that a lot of really popular technology companies and platforms that people use are mostly comprised of open source.

349
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:10,060
例如 有很多Rails Web 应用程序是极其成功的 盈利能力可观
S:恩 确实
Like, how many Rails web applications are super profitable and successful now. 
Enhmmm, absolutely.

350
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,810
而且我认为 对我们来说重要的是
And I think it's important for us to

351
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,940
确保这些公司对开源社区有管理权
ensure that those corporations have a stewardship to the open source community

352
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,510
认识到其价值所在
and recognize where their value is,

353
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,190
并给予回馈
and contribute it back.

354
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,100
好的 在 Safia 的开源中
Okay, so in Safia's open source

355
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,110
我们将其称为S.O.S 
we'll call it S.O.S.

356
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:31,950
企业将会负起责任
we have corporate accountability,

357
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,460
并对开源的可持续性做出贡献
and corporations contributing to the sustainability of open source.

358
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,910
项目的贡献者和维护者可能会因为自己所做的工作而获得报酬
We have contributors and maintainers possibly being paid themselves for the work that they do,

359
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:48,780
这样的开源多半会是更加开放、更具有关怀之心的模式
and generally a more loving and open brand for what open source is.

360
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,510
是的
Yeah.

361
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,070
听起来像是一个很棒的开源的版本 我喜欢它
Sounds like a great version of open source, I like it.

362
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,070
谢谢
Thank you.

363
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,990
Safia Abdalla 是交互计划的软件工程师和贡献者
Safia Abdalla is a software engineer and a contributor to the Interact Project.

364
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,990
她是一位新一代开发人员
She's part of a new generation of developers.

365
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,560
而她在平时也对开源抱有自己的期望
But even she's coming at it with the expectation of open source by default,

366
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,010
所以，我想向这支新的代码英雄军队大声呼喊
so I wanna give a shout out to that new army of command line heroes.

367
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,150
“你们都将会向我们展示未来，
You all are going to show us the future.

368
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,560
因为你们现在正生活在未来之中，
You're living it right now.

369
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,560
而你们也将负责领导我们走向明天。”
You're going to lead the charge.

370
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,170
*欢呼声*

371
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:31,000
*BGM*

372
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:36,360
现在 尽管我对开源革命心怀热情
Now as excited as I am for the open source revolution,

373
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,500
但我也不想成为一个盲目乐观的人
I don't wanna be a Pollyanna either.

374
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,700
开源也将会受到挑战
There are going to be challenges.

375
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,090
开源的存在越广泛
The bigger open source gets,

376
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,970
我们就越需要确保它的可持续性
the more we have to make sure that it's actually sustainable.

377
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,760
我们找到了一种可扩展的方式来维护开源项目吗？
Have we honestly figured out a scalable way of maintaining open source projects?

378
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,760
我的意思是 虽然 Linux 内核的贡献者中有一些是全职员工
I mean, the Linux kernels got some contributors who are full-time employees,

379
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:03,270
但是大多数的开源项目仍然是由志愿者维护的
but most of the open source projects out there are still maintained by volunteers.

380
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,300
开源的工作并不会因为我们不再“反叛”而终结
The work of open source isn't over just because we've graduated from rebel status.

381
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,030
市值数十亿美元的公司都在运行 Linux
Multi-billion dollar companies are running on Linux,

382
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,030
而开源先锋们现在是技术领袖
open source pioneers are now tech leaders,

383
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,330
我们需要跟随这条道路
we need to track this trajectory

384
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,710
并试着想象接下来会发生什么
and try to imagine what comes next.

385
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,710
尤其是 可能会出现什么问题
In particular, what could go wrong?

386
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,710
Christopher Tozzi 告诉我们 
Christopher Tozzi describes how open source,

387
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,200
曾经作为规则破坏者的开源并不对破坏本身免疫
once the disruptor, is not vulnerable to disruption itself.

388
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,000
开源革命尚未结束
The open source revolution is not over,

389
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,150
因为挑战并没有停止
because it's not as if the challenges are going to stop coming.

390
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,030
即使今天基本上地球上每个使用计算机的人
Even though today basically everybody on the planet who uses a computer

391
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,170
都在以这样或那样的方式使用开源软件
is using open source in one way or another,

392
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,170
但这并不代表开源必然是绝对安全的
that doesn't mean that open source is necessarily totally safe from disruption.

393
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:56,700
尤其是从致力于开源社区最初目标的人们的角度来看
Especially from the perspective of people who are committed to the original goals of the open source communities,

394
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,850
诸如云计算之类的事物确实使情况变得复杂了
which things like cloud computing really complicate in certain ways.

395
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,500
开源能有多开源呢？
How open source will open source be?

396
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,160
Christopher提到了云计算
Christopher mentioned cloud computing

397
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,860
而在第六集中
and in Episode 6,

398
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,030
我们描述了依赖于别人的数据中心
we described how becoming reliant on somebody else's datacenter

399
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,970
肯定会使开源最初的目标复杂化
definitely complicates the original goals of open source.

400
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,870
这是一个棘手的领域
It's tricky territory,

401
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,200
我们仍在了解这个领域的情况
and we're still learning the lay of the land.

402
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,970
在前进的过程中，
As we move forward,

403
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,900
我们必须不忘初心
we're gonna have to remind ourselves about our roots.

404
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:30,950
每个年轻的反叛者都需要欧比旺·克诺比的原力全息仪
Every young rebel needs that Obi Wan hologram moment.

405
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,870
他们会从过去吸取经验教训吗？
Will they get a reminder from the past?

406
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,670
林纳斯·托瓦兹Linus Torvalds曾经说过
Here's what our Linus Torvalds once said,

407
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,100
“在真正的开源中，你有权掌握自己的命运。”
"In real open source, you have the right to control your own destiny."

408
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:46,920
如果开发人员能够在更大的世界中宣扬这种精神
If developers helped to encourage that spirit in the bigger world,

409
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,330
那么 干得漂亮
that's a pretty good job.

410
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:02,340
到此为止 这是第一季的最后一集
So, this is the final episode of Season 1.

411
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,620
真不敢相信
Can you believe it?

412
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,710
这一季过得真快
This season just flew by.

413
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,110
在着手编写这一系列播客之前
Before working on this podcast,

414
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:13,300
我从没有想过 是谁创造了 DevOps、敏捷开发和云计算
things like DevOps, agile, and cloud, I didn't really think about where they came from,

415
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,360
我从没有想过它们从何而来
and who made them.

416
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,120
我从没想过它们会有自己的家
I never thought they had homes

417
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,150
有团队贡献才能、照顾它们 
with teams and talent who cared for them

418
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,250
帮助它们成长
and helped them grow.

419
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,310
们只是我工具箱里的一堆工具
They were just a bunch of tools in my toolbox.

420
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,200
但我现在不是这样看待它们的
But that's not how I see them now.

421
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,000
它们不仅仅是随机的工具 
They're not just random tools,

422
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,420
而是我生活环境的一部分
they're a part of the landscape I live in.
