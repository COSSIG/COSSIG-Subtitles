1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,040
有些故事如史诗般 惊险万分
Some stories are so epic with such high stakes that - in my head -

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,800
在我脑海中似乎出现了星球大战电影开头的滑动文本
it's like the crawling text at the start of a Star Wars movie.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,240
你知道的 就像
You know, like -

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,000
“第一集 操作系统大战”
Episode 1. The OS Wars.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,280
是的 就像那样子
Yeah, like that.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,760
这是一个局势加剧紧张的时期
It is a period of mounting tensions.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,840
比尔·盖茨与史蒂夫·乔布斯的帝国
The empires of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,120
发起了一场无可避免的专有软件之战
careen to ward an inevitable battle of proprietary software.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,600
盖茨与 IBM 结成了强大的联盟
Gates has formed a powerful alliance with IBM,

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,480
而乔布斯则拒绝开放他的硬件和操作系统授权
while Jobs refuses to license his hardware or operating system.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,880
他们争夺统治地位的战争 简直席卷了操作系统的“银河系”
Their battle for dominance threatens to engulf the galaxy in an OS war.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,440
与此同时 在这些“帝王们”所不知道的偏远之地
Meanwhile, in distant lands, and unbeknownst of the emperors,

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,120
信奉开源的“反叛者们”开始聚集
open source rebels have begun to gather.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,680
好吧 这也许有点戏剧性
Okay. Maybe that's a bit dramatic,

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,240
但当我们谈论上世纪八九十年代和 2000 年左右的操作系统之争时
but when we're talking about the OS wars at the 1980s, 90s and 2000s,

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,720
这也不算言过其实
it's hard to overstate things.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,400
确实曾经发生过一场史诗级的统治之战
There really was an epic battle for dominance.

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,600
史蒂夫·乔布斯和比尔·盖茨确实掌握着许多人的命运
Steve Jobs and Bill Gates really did hold the fates of billions in their hands.

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,120
掌控了操作系统
Control the operating system,

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,400
你就掌握了绝大多数人使用计算机的方式
and you control how the vast majority of people use computers.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,760
互相通讯的方式、获取信息的方式
How we communicate with each other. How we source information.

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,440
我可以一直罗列下去 不过你知道我的意思
I could go on but you know all this.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,040
掌握了操作系统 你就是帝王
Control the OS, and you would be an emperor.

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,920
我是 Saron Yitbarek 你现在收听的是代码英雄
I'm Saron Yitbarek, and you are listening to Command Line Heroes,

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,840
一款红帽公司原创的播客节目
an original podcast from Red Hat.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,680
你问什么是代码英雄？
What is a command line hero, you ask?

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,760
嗯 如果你愿意用创造代替使用
Well, if you would rather make something than just use it,

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,400
如果你相信开发者拥有构建美好未来的能力
if you believe developers have the power to build a better future,

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,520
如果你希望拥有一个大家都有权利用科技塑造生活的世界
if you want a world where we all get a say in how our technology shape our lives,

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,120
那么你 我的朋友 就是一位代码英雄
then you, my friend, are a command line hero.

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,720
在本系列节目中 我们将为你带来
In this series, we bring you stories of the developers among us

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,200
那些“白码起家”改变技术的程序员故事
who were transforming tech from the command line up.

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,560
那么我是谁 凭什么指引你踏上这段艰苦的旅程？
And who am I to be guiding you on this track?

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,080
Saron Yitbarek 是哪根葱？
Who is Saron Yitbarek?

35
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,400
嗯 事实上我觉得我跟你差不多
Well, actually, I'm guessing I'm a lot like you.

36
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,960
首先 我是一个开发者
I'm a developer for starters,

37
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,240
我做的任何事都依赖于开源软件
and everything I do depends on open source software.

38
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,200
我的世界就是如此
It's my world.

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,280
通过在博客中讲故事
The stories we tell on this podcast

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,720
我可以跳出无聊的日常工作 鸟瞰全景
are a way for me to get above the daily grind of my work and see that big picture.

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,280
希望这对你也一样有用
I hope it does the same thing for you too.

42
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,320
我迫不及待地想知道
What I wanted to know right off the bat was

43
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,800
开源技术从何而来？
where did the open source technology even come from?

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,640
我的意思是 我对林纳斯·托瓦兹和 Linux® 的荣耀有一些了解
I mean, I know a fair bit about Linus Torvalds and the glories of Linux®,

45
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,080
我相信你也一样
as I'm sure you do too.

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,240
但是说真的 开源并不是一开始就有的对吗？
But really, there was life before open source, right?

47
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,800
如果我想发表对这些最新 最棒的技术
And if I want to truly appreciate the latest and greatest things

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,680
比如 DevOps 和容器的感激
like DevOps and containers and on and on,

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,600
为了那些早期的开发者 我有义务了解它们从何而来
well, I feel like I owe it to all those earlier developers

50
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,200
为了那些早期的开发者 我有义务了解它们从何而来
to know where this stuff came from.

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,400
所以 让我们暂时先不用担心内存泄露和缓冲溢出
So, let's take a short break

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,520
所以 让我们暂时先不用担心内存泄露和缓冲溢出
from worrying about memory leaks and buffer overflows.

53
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,440
我们的旅程将从操作系统之战开始
Our journey begins with the OS wars,

54
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,800
这是一场波澜壮阔的桌面控制之战
that epic battle for control of the desk top.

55
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,920
这场战争亘古未有 因为：
It was like nothing that the world had ever seen, and I'll tell you why.

56
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,640
首先 在计算机时代
First, in the age of computing,

57
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,240
大公司拥有指数级的规模优势
you've got exponentially scaling advantages for the big fish.

58
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,040
其次 从未有过这么一场控制争夺战是如此变化多端
And second, there's never been such a battle for control

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,400
其次 从未有过这么一场控制争夺战是如此变化多端
on a ground that's constantly shifting.

60
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,440
比尔·盖茨和史蒂夫·乔布斯? 目前为止他们也不知道事情会如何发展
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs? They don't know it yet,

61
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,120
但是到这个故事进行到一半的时候
but by the time this story is halfway done,

62
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,200
他们所争夺的所有东西都将发生改变、进化
everything they're fighting for is going to change, evolve,

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,120
最终上升到云端
and even ascend into the cloud.

64
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,000
好的 让我们回到 1983 年的秋季 还有六年我才出生
Okay. It's the fall of 1983, I was negative six years old.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,520
那时候的总统还是罗纳德·里根
Ronald Regan's the president,

66
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,040
美国和苏联扬言要把地球拖入核战争之中
and the US and the Soviet Union are threatening to drag the planet into nucler war.

67
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,760
在檀香山（火奴鲁鲁）的市政中心
Over the city center of Honolulu,

68
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,320
正在举办一年一度的苹果公司销售会议
it's the annual Apple sales conference.

69
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,160
一群苹果公司的员工正在等待史蒂夫·乔布斯上台
An exclusive bunch of Apple emplyees are waiting for Steve Jobs to get on stage.

70
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,960
他 28 岁 热情洋溢 看起来非常自信
He's the super-bright-eyed twenty-eight-year-old,

71
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,200
他 28 岁 热情洋溢 看起来非常自信
and he's looking pretty confident.

72
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,880
乔布斯很严肃地对着麦克风说
In a very serious voice, Jobs speaks into the mic and says

73
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,720
他邀请了三个行业专家
that he's invited three industry experts to have

74
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,000
来就他的软件进行一次小组讨论
a penal discussion on software.

75
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,000
然而随后发生的事情你肯定想不到
But the next thing that happenes is not what you would expect.

76
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,200
超级俗气的 80 年代音乐响彻整个房间
Super cheesy 80s music fills the room,

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,120
一堆多彩灯管照亮了舞台
a bunch of multicolored tube lights light up the stage,

78
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,760
然后一个播音员的声音响起 
and then an announcer's voice says-

79
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,040
女士们 先生们 现在是麦金塔软件的约会游戏时间
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Macintosh Software Dating Game.

80
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,640
带着大大的笑容 乔布斯宣布
Jobs has this big grin on his face as he reveals

81
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,400
台上的三个CEO必须轮流向他示好
that the three CEOs on stage have to take turns wooing him.

82
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,320
他简直就是 80 年代科技界的钻石王老五
It's essentially an 80s version of The Bachelor, but for tech love.

83
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,400
两个软件大佬讲完话
Two of the software bigwigs say their bit,

84
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,640
接着轮到了第三个人
and then it's over to contestant number three.

85
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,080
难不成 ？是的
Is that-? Yep.

86
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,440
那是年轻的比尔·盖茨 戴着一服大大的 遮住了半张脸的方框眼镜
A fresh-faced Bill Gates with large square glasses that cover half his face.

87
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,760
他宣称在1984年
He proclaimes that during 1984,

88
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,040
微软一半的收入渠道会来源于麦金塔软件
half of Microsoft's avenue was gonna come from Macintosh Software.

89
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,000
他的这番话引来了观众热情的掌声
The audience loves it, and give him a big round of applause.

90
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,960
但是他们不知道的是 在一个月后
What they don't know is that one month after this event,

91
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,280
比尔·盖茨将会宣布发布 Windows 1.0 的计划
Bill Gates will announce his plans to release Windows 1.0.

92
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,280
你永远也猜不到乔布斯正在跟苹果未来最大的敌人打情骂俏
You'd never guess Jobs is flirting with someone who'd end up as Apple's biggest rival.

93
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,960
但微软和苹果即将举行科技史上最糟糕的婚礼
But Microsoft and Apple are about to live through the worst marriage in tech history.

94
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,400
他们会彼此背叛、相互毁灭
They're going to betray each other, they're going to try and destroy each other,

95
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,000
但又深深地、痛苦地捆绑在一起
and they're going to be deeply, painfully bound to each other.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,880
我猜从哲学角度上来讲 苹果是更理想化、注重用户体验高于一切
I guess philosophically, one was more idealistic and focused on the user experience above all else,

97
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,760
一体化的组织
and was an integrated organization,

98
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,600
而微软则更务实 更模块化 
whereas Microsoft much more pragmatic, a modular focus-

99
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
这位是 James Allworth That's James Allworth.

100
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,040
他是一位高产的科技作家 曾在苹果零售的企业团队工作
He's a prolific tech writer who worked inside the corporate team of Apple Retail.

101
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,160
注意他对苹果的定义 一个一体化的组织
Notice that definition of Apple he gives. An integrated organization.

102
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,400
那种只对自己负责 不想依赖别人的公司 这是关键
That sense of a company beholden only to itself. A company that doesn't want to rely on others. That's key.

103
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,680
苹果是一家一体化的公司
Apple was the integrated player,

104
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,240
它希望专注于令人愉悦的用户体验
and it wanted to focus on a delightful user experience,

105
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,600
这意味着它希望控制整个技术栈以及交付的一切内容：
and that meant that it wanted to control the entire stack and everything that was delivered,

106
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,240
从硬件到操作系统
from the hardware to the operating system,

107
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,840
甚至运行在操作系统上的应用程序 to even some of the applications that ran on top of the operating system.

108
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,480
新的 重要的创新需要横跨软硬件
And that always served it well in periods where new innovations, important innovations,

109
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:19,360
才能很好地进入市场
were coming to market where you needed to be across both hardware and software,

110
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,160
当你能够根据自己意愿来改变软件和硬件时
and where being able to change the hardware based on what you wanted to do

111
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,160
你就有了极大的优势
that was new in software was an advantage.

112
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,760
例如
For example-

113
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,000
很多人喜欢这种一体化的模式 并因此成为了苹果的铁杆粉丝
A lot of people loved that integration, and became die hard Apple fans.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
不过还有是很多人则选择了微软
Plenty of others stuck with Microsoft.

115
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
让我们回到檀香山的销售会议上
Back to that sales conference in Honolulu.

116
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,160
在同一场活动中 乔布斯向观众展示了他即将发布的超级碗广告
At that very same event, Jobs gave his audience a sneak peek at the Superbowl ad he was about to release.

117
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,520
你可能已经亲眼见过这则广告了
You might have seen it for yourself.

118
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,160
想想乔治·奥威尔的 《一九八四》
Think George Orwell's 1984.

119
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,600
在这个冰冷、灰暗的世界里
In this cold and gray world,

120
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,120
无意识的机器人正在独裁者投射的凝视下徘徊
mindless automatons are shuffling along under a dictator's projected gaze.

121
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,240
这些机器人代表 IBM 的用户
They represent IBM users.

122
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,400
然后 代表苹果公司的 漂亮而健美的安娅·梅杰
Then, beautiful, athletic Anya Major, representing Apple,

123
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,720
穿着鲜艳的衣服跑过大厅
comes running through the hall in full color.

124
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,760
她向着老大哥的屏幕猛地投出大锤 将它砸成了碎片
She hurls her sledgehammer at Big Brother's screen, smashing it to bits.

125
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,000
老大哥的咒语解除了
Big Brother's spell is broken,

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,320
一个低沉的声音响起 苹果公司要开始介绍麦金塔了
and a booming voice tells us that Apple is about to introduce the Macintosh.

127
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:17,560
这就是为什么我们的 1984 年 跟小说《一九八四》描写的不一样
And you'll see why 1984 will not be like 1984.

128
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,560
是的 现在回顾那则广告
And yeah, looking back at that commercial,

129
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,800
把苹果说成一个致力于解放大众的自由斗士有点言过其实了
the idea that Apple was a freedom fighter working to set the masses free is a bit much.

130
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,320
但这则广告触动了人们的神经
But the thing hit a nerve.

131
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,480
Ken Segal 曾在为苹果制作这则广告的广告公司工作过
Ken Segal worked at the advertising firm that made the commercial for Apple.

132
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,400
他为史蒂夫·乔布斯工作了十多年
He was Steve Jobs' advertising guy for more than a decade in the early days.

133
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,240
1984 这则广告的负担的风险很大
Well, the 1984 commercial came with a lot of risk.

134
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,600
事实上 它的风险实在太大
In fact, it was so risky

135
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,800
乃至苹果公司在看到它的时候都不想播出它
that Apple didn't want to run it when they saw it.

136
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,800
你可能听说了史蒂夫喜欢它
You've probably heard stories that Steve liked it,

137
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,920
但苹果公司董事会的人并不喜欢它
but the Apple board did not like it.

138
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,200
事实上他们很愤怒 为什么这么多钱被花在这样一件事情上
In fact, they were so outraged that so much money had been spent on such a thing

139
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,280
以至于他们想解雇广告代理商
that they wanted to fire the ad agency.

140
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,520
史蒂夫则为我们公司辩护
Steve was the one sticking up for the agency.

141
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,280
乔布斯一如既往地 慧眼识英雄
Jobs, as usual, knew a good mythology when he saw one.

142
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,600
这则广告在公司内、在业界内都引起了共鸣
That commercial struck such a chord within the company, within the industry,

143
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,880
成为了苹果产品的代表
that it became this thing for Apple.

144
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,000
无论人们那天是否有在购买电脑
Whether or not people were buying computers that day,

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,640
它都带来了一种持之以恒的影响
it had a sort of an aura that stayed around for years and years and years,

146
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,800
并让大家在心里定义了这家公司的立场：
and helped define the character of the company.

147
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,160
我们是叛军 我们是拿着大锤的人
We're the rebels. We're the guys with the sledgehammer.

148
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,200
因此 在争夺数十亿潜在消费者心智的过程中
So in their battle for the hearts and minds of literally billions of potential consumers,

149
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,960
苹果公司和微软公司的帝王们正在学着把自己塑造成救世主、
the emperors of Apple and Microsoft were learning to frame themselves as redeemers.

150
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,560
非凡的英雄 选择自己就是选择一种生活方式
As singular heroes. As lifestyle choices.

151
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,200
但比尔·盖茨明白一些苹果难以理解的事情
But Bill Gates knew something that Apple had trouble understanding.

152
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,600
那就是在一个相互连接的世界里
This idea that in a wired world,

153
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,760
没有人   即便他是帝王 能独自完成任务
nobody, not even an emperor, can really go it alone.

154
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,520
1985 年 6 月 25 日
June 25th, 1985.

155
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,880
盖茨给当时的苹果 CEO John Scully 发了一份备忘录
Gates sends a memo to Apple's then CEO John Scully.

156
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
那是一个迷失的年代
This was during the wilderness years.

157
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,440
乔布斯刚刚被逐出公司 直到 1996 年才回到苹果
Jobs had just been excommunicated, and wouldn't return to Apple until 1996.

158
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,640
也许正是因为乔布斯离开了 盖茨才敢写这份东西
Maybe it was because Jobs was out that Gates felt confident enough to write what he wrote.

159
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,240
在备忘录中 他鼓励苹果授权制造商分发他们的操作系统
In the memo, he encourages Apple to license their OS to clone makers.

160
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,720
我想读一下备忘录的最后部分
I want to read a bit from the end of the memo,

161
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,040
让你们知道这份备忘录是多么的有洞察力
just to give you a sense of how perceptive it was.

162
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,560
盖茨写道：“如果没有其他个人电脑制造商的支持
Gates writes, "It is now impossible for Apple to create a standard out of their innovative technology

163
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,080
苹果现在不可能让他们的创新技术成为标准
without support from other personal computer manufacturers.

164
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,240
苹果必须开放麦金塔的架构
Apple must open the Macintosh architecture

165
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,760
以获得个人建造商的支持来快速发展和建立标准 ”
to have the independent support required to gain momentum and establish a standard."

166
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,560
换句话说 你们不要再自己玩自己的了
In other words, no more operating in a silo, you guys.

167
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,960
你们必须有与他人合作的意愿
You've got to be willing to partner with others.

168
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,240
你们必须与开发者合作
You have to work with developers.

169
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,560
多年后你依然可以看到这条思想
You see this philosophy years later,

170
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,040
当微软首席执行官史蒂夫·鲍尔默上台做主题演讲时 他开始大喊：
when Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer gets up on stage to give a keynote and he starts shouting,

171
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,400
“开发者、开发者、开发者、开发者、
"Developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers.

172
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:09,320
开发者、开发者、开发者、开发者、开发者 ”
Developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers."

173
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,560
你懂我的意思了吧 微软喜欢开发人员
You get the idea. Microsoft likes developers.

174
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,120
不是说他们打算与开发人员共享源代码
Now, they're not about to share source code with them,

175
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,280
但是他们确实想建立起整个为合作伙伴服务的生态系统
but they do want to build this whole ecosystem of partners.

176
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,000
而当比尔·盖茨建议苹果公司也这么做时
And when Bill Gates suggests that Apple do the same,

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,280
如你可能已经猜到的 这个想法被苹果公司抛到了九霄云外
as you might have guessed, the idea is tossed out the window.

178
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,560
苹果划清了界限
Apple had drawn a line in the sand,

179
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,920
五个月后 微软发布了 Windows 1.0
and five months after they trashed Gates' memo, Microsoft released Windows 1.0.

180
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,920
战争开始了
The war was on.

181
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,680
开发者、开发者、开发者、开发者、
Developers, developers, developers, developers,

182
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,640
开发者、开发者、开发者、开发者、
developers, developers, developers, developers,

183
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,640
开发者、开发者、开发者、开发者、
developers, developers, developers, developers,

184
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,600
开发者、开发者、开发者、开发者、开发者、开发者
developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers.

185
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,600
你正在收听的是来自红帽公司的原创播客《代码英雄》
You're listening to Command Line Heroes, an original podcast from Red Hat.

186
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,640
本集是第一集 我们将回到过去 重温操作系统战争的史诗
In this inaugural episode, we go back in time to relive the epic story of the OS wars,

187
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,880
我们将会发现 科技巨头之间的战争
and we're going to find out, how did a war between tech giants

188
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,200
是如何为我们今天所生活的开源世界开辟前路的
clear the way for the open source world we all live in today?

189
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,840
好的 让我们先来个背景故事吧
Okay, a little backstory.

190
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,240
如果你已经听过了也请别介意 它实在是经典
And forgive me if you've heard this one, but it's a classic.

191
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,040
当时是 1979 年
It's 1979,

192
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,520
史蒂夫·乔布斯开车去帕洛阿尔托的施乐公园研究中心
and Steve Jobs drives up to the Xerox Park research center in Palo Alto.

193
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,200
那里的工程师一直在为他们所谓的图形用户界面
The engineers there have been developing this whole fleet of elements

194
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,080
开发一系列的元素
for what they call a graphical user interface.

195
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,240
也许你听说过
Maybe you've heard of it.

196
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,680
它们有菜单、滚动条、按钮、文件夹和层叠的窗口
They've got menus, they've got scroll bars, they've got buttons and folders and overlapping windows.

197
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,840
这是对计算机界面的一个前所未有的美丽新设想
It was a beautiful new vision of what a computer interface could look like. And nobody had any of this stuff.

198
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,280
作家兼记者 Steve Levy 谈到了它的潜力
Author and journalist Steven Levy talks about its potential.

199
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,040
有很多人为这个新界面令人感到激动
There was a lot of excitement about this new interface

200
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,280
它比以前的交互界面更友好
that was going to be much friendlier than what we had before,

201
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,400
以前用的交互界面被称为命令行 
which used what was called the command line,

202
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:13,040
这不是在现实生活中使用的交互方式
where there was really no interaction between you and the computer in the way you'd interact with something in real life.

203
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,600
鼠标和电脑上的图像
The mouse and the graphics on the computer gave you a way to do that,

204
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,560
让你可以像指向现实生活中的东西一样 指向电脑上的东西
to point to something just like you'd point to something in real life.

205
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,760
这让事情变得简单多了 你不需要记住那些代码
It made it a lot easier. You didn't have to memorize all these codes.

206
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,200
不过 施乐的高管们并没有意识到他们正坐在白金矿上
Except, the Xerox executives did not get that they were sitting on top of a platinum mine.

207
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,720
一如既往地 工程师比主管们更清楚它的价值
The engineers were more aware than the execs. Typical.

208
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
因此那些工程师
So those engineers were, yeah,

209
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,040
在被要求向乔布斯展示这些东西是如何工作时 有点紧张
a little stressed out that they were instructed to show Jobs how everything worked.

210
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,200
然而这毕竟是高管的命令
But the executives were calling the shots.

211
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,560
用乔布斯的话来说 他认为
Jobs felt, quote,

212
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,480
“这个天才产品本来能够让施乐公司垄断整个行业
"The product genius that brought them to that monopolistic position

213
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,200
却被公司的经营者毁了
gets rotted out by people running these companies

214
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,800
因为他们对产品的好坏没有概念 ”
that have no conception of a good product versus a bad product."

215
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,560
这话有些苛刻
That's sort of harsh,

216
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,760
但是 乔布斯带着一卡车施乐高管忽视的想法离开了会议
but hey, Jobs walked out of that meeting with a truckload of ideas that Xerox executives had missed.

217
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,800
这几乎包含了所有他革新桌面计算体验需要的东西
Pretty much everything he needed to revolutionize the desktop computing experience.

218
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,120
1983 年 苹果发布了 Lisa 电脑
Apple releases the Lisa in 1983,

219
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
1984 年又发布了 Mac 电脑
and then the Mac in 1984.

220
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,680
这些设备的创意都是抄袭自施乐公司的
These devices are made by the ideas swiped from Xerox.

221
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,840
让我感兴趣的是
What's interesting to me

222
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,560
乔布斯对控诉他偷了图形用户界面的反应
is Jobs' reaction to the claim that he stole the GUI.

223
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
他对此很冷静
He's pretty philosophical about it.

224
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,280
他引用毕加索的话：“好的艺术家抄袭 伟大的艺术家偷窃 ”
He quotes Picasso, saying, "Good artists copy, great artists steal."

225
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,760
他告诉一位记者 “我们总是无耻地窃取伟大的创意 ”
He tells one reporter, "We have always been shameless about stealing great ideas."

226
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
伟大的艺术家偷窃 好吧
Great artists steal. Okay.

227
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,400
我的意思是 我们说的并不是严格意义上的“偷窃”
I mean, we're not talking about stealing in a hard sense.

228
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,680
没人拿到了专有的源代码
Nobody's obtaining proprietary source code

229
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,280
并公然将其集成到他们自己的操作系统中去
and blatantly incorporating it into their operating system.

230
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,400
这事情更温和些 更像是创意的借用
This is softer, more like idea borrowing.

231
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,040
但乔布斯自己即将学到 这东西很难以控制
And that's much more difficult to control, as Jobs himself was about to learn.

232
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,160
传奇的软件奇才、真正的代码英雄
Andy Hertzfeld
Legendary software wizard, and true command line hero, Andy Hertzfeld,

233
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,040
就是麦金塔开发团队的最初成员
was an original member of the Macintosh development team.

234
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,720
是的 微软是麦金塔电脑软件的第一个合作伙伴
Yeah, Microsoft was our first software partner with the Macintosh.

235
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,600
当时 我们并没有把他们当成是竞争对手
At the time, we didn't really consider them a competitor.

236
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,080
他们是苹果之外 我们第一家交付麦金塔电脑原型的公司
They were the very first company outside of Apple that we gave Macintosh prototypes to.

237
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,920
我通常每周都会和微软的技术主管聊一次
I talked with the technical lead at Microsoft usually once a week.

238
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,000
他们是第一个试用我们所编写软件的外部团队
They were the first outside party trying out the software that we wrote.

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,040
他们给了我们非常重要的反馈
They gave us very important feedback,

240
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,520
总的来说 我认为我们的关系非常好
and in general I would say the relationship was pretty good.

241
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,120
但我也注意到 在我与技术主管的交谈中
But I also noticed in my conversations with the technical lead,

242
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:40,320
他开始问一些系统实现方面的问题 而他本无需知道这些
he started asking questions that he didn't really need to know about how the system was implemented,

243
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,880
我觉得他们想要复制麦金塔电脑
and I got the idea that they were trying to copy the Macintosh.

244
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,560
我很早以前就向史蒂夫·乔布斯反馈过这件事
I told Steve Jobs about it pretty early on,

245
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,080
但在 1983 年秋天 这件事发展到了高潮
but it really came to a head in the fall of 1983.

246
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,520
我们发现 他们没有提前告诉我们
We discovered that they actually, without telling us ahead of time,

247
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,600
就在 1983 年 11 月的 COMDEX 上发布了 Windows
they announced Windows at the COMDEX in November 1983

248
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,000
对此史蒂夫·乔布斯勃然大怒
and Steve Jobs hit the roof.

249
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,400
他认为那是一种背叛
He really considered that a betrayal.

250
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,400
随着新版 Windows 的发布
As newer versions of Windows were released,

251
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,920
很明显 微软从苹果那里学到了
it became pretty clear that Microsoft had lifted from Apple

252
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,960
苹果从施乐那里学来的所有想法
all the ideas that Apple had lifted from Xerox.

253
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,240
乔布斯变得很易怒
Jobs was apoplectic.

254
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,320
他发表的伟大艺术家善于偷窃的毕加索名言被别人学去了 
His Picasso line about how great artists steal. Yeah. That goes out the window.

255
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,560
盖茨也正是这么做的
Though maybe Gates was using it now.

256
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,800
据报道 当乔布斯怒斥盖茨偷了他们的东西时 盖茨回应道：
Reportedly, when Jobs screamed at Gates that he'd stolen from them, Gates responded,

257
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,800
“史蒂夫 我觉得这更像是我们都有一个叫施乐的富有邻居
"Well Steve, I think it's more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox,

258
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,960
我闯进他家偷电视机
and I broke into his house to steal the TV set,

259
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,240
却发现你已经偷过了”
and found out that you'd already stolen it."

260
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,160
苹果最终以窃取 GUI 的外观和风格为名起诉了微软
Apple ends up suing Microsoft for stealing the look and feel of their GUI.

261
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,000
这个案子持续了好几年
The case goes on for years,

262
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,760
但是在 1993 年 第 9 巡回上诉法院的一名法官
but in 1993, a judge from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals

263
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,600
最终站在了微软一边
finally sides with Microsoft.

264
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,400
Vaughn Walker 法官宣布外观和风格不受版权保护
Judge Vaughn Walker declares that look and feel are not covered by copyright,

265
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,560
这是非常重要的事情
and this is super important.

266
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,800
这一决定让苹果再无法垄断桌面计算的界面
That decision prevented Apple from creating a monopoly

267
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,760
这一决定让苹果再无法垄断桌面计算的界面
with the interface that would dominate desktop computing.

268
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,880
很快 苹果短暂的领先优势消失了
Soon enough, Apple's brief lead had vanished.

269
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,320
以下是 Steven Levy 的观点
Here's Steven Levy's take.

270
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,040
他们之所以失去领先地位 不是因为微软方面窃取了知识产权
They lost the lead not because of intellectual property theft on Microsoft's part,

271
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,840
而是因为他们无法巩固自己在上世纪 80 年代就拥有的
but because they were unable to consolidate their advantage

272
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,080
更优越的操作系统的优势
in having a better operating system during the 1980s.

273
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,120
坦率地说 他们的电脑索价过高
They overcharged for their computers, quite frankly.

274
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,800
微软从 20 世纪 80 年代中期开始开发 Windows 系统
So Microsoft had been developing Windows, starting with the mid-1980s,

275
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,240
但直到 1990 年才开发出来 Windows 3
but it wasn't until Windows 3 in 1990, I believe,

276
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,720
我想 这算是第一个开启黄金时代的版本
where they really came across with a version that was ready for prime time.

277
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,960
真正可供大众使用
Ready for masses of people to use.

278
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:52,480
从此以后 微软能够将数以亿计的用户迁移到图形界面
At that point is where Microsoft was able to migrate huge numbers of people, hundreds of millions,

279
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,440
而这是苹果无法做到的
over to the graphical interface in a way that Apple had not been able to do.

280
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,960
虽然苹果公司有一个非常好的操作系统
Even though they had a really good operating system,

281
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,520
但是那已经是 1984 年的产品了
they used it since 1984.

282
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,720
现在微软主导着操作系统的战场
Microsoft now dominated the OS battlefield.

283
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,360
他们占据了 90% 的市场份额
They held 90% of the market,

284
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,600
并且针对各种各样的个人电脑进行了标准化
and standardized their OS across a whole variety of PCs.

285
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,720
操作系统的未来看起来会由微软掌控
The future of the OS looked like it'd be controlled by Microsoft.

286
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,720
在此后发生了什么？
And then?

287
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,400
1997 年 波士顿 Macworld 博览会上
Well, at the 1997 Macworld Expo in Boston,

288
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,840
你看到了一个几近破产的苹果
you have an almost bankrupt Apple.

289
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,480
一个比之前谦逊得多的史蒂夫·乔布斯走上舞台
A more humble Steve Jobs gets on stage,

290
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,400
开始谈论伙伴关系的重要性 
and starts talking about the importance of partnerships,

291
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,720
其中之一已经变得格外重要
and one in particular, he says, has become very, very meaningful.

292
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,160
那就是和微软的合作
Their new partnership with Microsoft.

293
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,680
史蒂夫·乔布斯呼吁双方缓和关系 停止火拼
Steve Jobs is calling for a détente, a ceasefire.

294
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,160
微软将坐享巨大的市场份额
Microsoft could have their enormous market share.

295
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,840
从表面看 我们可能会认为世界和平了
If we didn't know better, we might think we were entering a period of peace in the kingdom.

296
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,600
但当利益如此巨大时 事情就没那么简单了
But when stakes are this high, it's never that simple.

297
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,120
就在苹果和微软在数十年的争斗中伤痕累累、
Just as Apple and Microsoft were finally retreating to their corners,

298
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,120
最终败退到死角之际
pretty bruised from decades of fighting,

299
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,840
一名 21 岁的芬兰计算机科学专业学生出现了
along came a 21-year-old Finnish computer science student

300
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,360
十分偶然的 他彻底改变了一切
who, almost by accident, changed absolutely everything.

301
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,000
我是 Saron Yitbarek 这里是代码英雄
I'm Saron Yitbarek, and this is Command Line Heroes.

302
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,640
正当某些科技巨头正忙着就专有软件相互攻击时
While certain tech giants were busy bashing each other over proprietary software,

303
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,640
自由软件和开源软件的新领军者如雨后春笋般涌现
there were new champions of free and open source software popping up like mushrooms.

304
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,160
其中一位优胜者就是理查德·斯托曼
One of these champions was Richard Stallman.

305
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,680
你也许对他的工作很熟悉
You're probably familiar with his work.

306
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,280
他想要拥有自由软件的自由社会
He wanted free software and a free society.

307
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,840
这就像言论自由一样的自由
That's free as in free speech,

308
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,080
而不是像免费啤酒一样的免费
not free as in free beer.

309
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,440
早在 80 年代 斯托尔曼就发现
Back in the '80s, Stallman saw that

310
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,240
除了昂贵的专有操作系统（如 UNIX）外
there was no viable alternative

311
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,440
没有其他可行的替代品
to pricey, proprietary OSs, like UNIX .

312
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,720
因此他决定自己做一个
So, he decided to make his own.

313
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,520
斯托尔曼的自由软件基金会开发了 GNU
Stallman's Free Software Foundation developed GNU,

314
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,640
当然 它的意思是 “GNU's not UNIX”
which stood for GNU's not UNIX , of course.

315
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,760
它将是一个像 UNIX 一样的操作系统
It'd be an OS like UNIX,

316
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,400
但不包含 UNIX 代码
but free of all UNIX code,

317
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
而且所有用户可以自由共享它
and free for users to share.

318
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,400
为了让你体会到上世纪 80 年代自由软件概念的重要性
Just to give you a sense of how important that idea of free software was in the 1980s,

319
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,400
从不同角度来说拥有 UNIX 代码的两家公司
the companies that owned the UNIX code at different points,

320
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,960
AT&T 贝尔实验室以及UNIX 系统实验室
AT&T Bell Laboratories and then UNIX System Laboratories,

321
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,480
威胁将会起诉任何看过 UNIX 源代码后又创建自己操作系统的人
they threatened lawsuits on anyone making their own OS after looking at UNIX source code.

322
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,040
这些人的占有欲简直是另一种层面
These guys were next - level proprietary.

323
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
用这两家公司的话来说
All those programmers were,

324
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,800
所有这些程序员都在“精神上受到了污染”
in the words of the two companies, "mentally contaminated,"

325
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,160
因为他们都见过 UNIX 代码
because they'd seen UNIX code.

326
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,640
在 UNIX 系统实验室
In a famous court case

327
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,800
和伯克利软件设计公司之间的一个著名的法庭案例中
between UNIX System Laboratories and Berkeley Software Design,

328
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,480
有人认为即使它本身没有使用 UNIX 代码
it was argued that any functionally similar system,

329
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,400
拥有类似功能的系统也侵犯版权
even though it didn't use the UNIX code itself, was a breach of copyright.

330
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,480
Paul Jones 当时是一名开发人员
Paul Jones was a developer at that time.

331
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,320
他现在是数字图书馆 ibiblio.org 的主管 He's now the director of the digital library ibiblio.org.

332
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:56,360
他们的观点是 任何看过代码的人 都受到了精神污染
Anyone who has seen any of the code is mentally contaminated was their argument.

333
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:03,040
因此 几乎所有在安装有与 UNIX 相关操作系统的电脑上工作过的人
And that would have made almost anyone who had worked on a computer operating system that involved UNIX ,

334
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,480
以及任何在计算机科学部门工作的人
and any computer science department that was in the country,

335
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
都受到了精神上的污染
was mentally contaminated.

336
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,760
在 USENIX 的一年里
So in one year at USENIX,

337
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,160
我们都得到了一个写着红色字母的白色小别针
we all got little white bar pins with red letters

338
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,800
上面写着“精神受到了污染”
that say mentally contaminated,

339
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,640
我们很喜欢带着这些别针到处走
and we all wear those around to our own great pleasure,

340
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,240
表达我们在这件事上对贝尔实验室的讽刺
to show that we were sticking it to Bell because we were mentally contaminated.

341
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,320
整个世界都被精神污染了
The whole world was getting mentally contaminated.

342
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,360
想要保持纯粹、保持事物的美好
Staying pure, keeping things nice and proprietary,

343
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,840
和完整地拥有一个软件的旧思想正变得越来越不现实
that old philosophy was getting less and less realistic.

344
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,480
正是在这被污染的现实中
It was into this contaminated reality

345
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,160
历史上最伟大的代码英雄之一诞生了
that one of history's biggest command line heroes was born,

346
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,400
他是一个芬兰男孩 名叫林纳斯·托瓦兹
a boy in Finland named Linus Torvalds.

347
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,200
如果这是《星球大战》 那么林纳斯·托瓦兹就是我们的卢克·天行者
If this is Star Wars, then Linus Torvalds is our Luke Skywalker.

348
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,440
他是赫尔辛基大学的一名温文尔雅的研究生
He was a mild-mannered grad student at the University of Helsinki.

349
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,160
有才华 但缺乏大志
Talented, but lacking in grand visions.

350
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,080
典型的被逼上梁山的英雄
The classic reluctant hero.

351
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,480
和其他年轻的英雄一样 他也感到沮丧
And, like any young hero, he was also frustrated.

352
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,360
他想把 386 处理器整合到他的新电脑中
He wanted to incorporate the 386 processor into his new PC's functions.

353
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,760
他对自己兼容 IBM 的电脑上运行 MS-DOS 操作系统并不感冒
He wasn't impressed by the MS-DOS running on his IBM clone,

354
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,280
也负担不起 UNIX 软件 5000 美元的价格
and he couldn't afford the $5,000 price tag on the UNIX software

355
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,080
但只有 UNIX 才能让他自由地编程
that would have given him some programming freedom.

356
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,280
解决方案是 托瓦兹在 1991 年春天
The solution, which Torvalds crafted on MINIX in the spring of 1991,

357
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,160
基于 MINIX 开发了一个名为 Linux 的操作系统内核
was an OS kernel called Linux.

358
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,640
他自己的操作系统内核
The kernel of an OS of his very own.

359
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,720
林纳斯·托瓦兹真的只是想找点乐子而已
Linus Torvalds really just wanted to have something to play with.

360
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,600
Steven Vaughan-Nichols 是 ZDNet.com 的特约编辑
Steven Vaughan-Nichols is a contributing editor at ZDNet.com,

361
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,160
而且他从科技行业出现以来就一直在写科技行业相关的内容
and he's been writing about the business of technology since there was a business of technology.

362
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,280
当时有几个类似的操作系统
There were a couple of operating systems like it at the time.

363
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,240
他最关注的是一个名叫 MINIX 
The main one that he was concerned about was called MINIX,

364
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:55,320
旨在让学生学习如何构建操作系统的项目
and that was an operating system that was meant for students to learn how to build operating systems.

365
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,960
林纳斯看到了这些并且觉得它很有趣
Linus looked at that, and thought that it was interesting,

366
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,560
但他打算建立自己的操作系统
but he wanted to build his own.

367
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:06,120
所以 Linux 实际上始于赫尔辛基的一个 DIY 项目
So it really started as a do-it-yourself project at Helsinki.

368
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,840
一切就这样开始了
And that's how it all started,

369
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:16,000
基本上就是一个大孩子在玩耍 学习如何做些什么
it's just basically a big kid playing around and learning how to do things.

370
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:25,920
但不同之处在于 他足够聪明、足够执着
But what was different in his case is that he was both bright enough and persistent enough,

371
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,200
也足够友好 能让其他人都参与进来
and also friendly enough to get all these other people working on it,

372
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,680
然后他开始把这个项目进行到底
and then he started seeing the project through.

373
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,400
27 年后 这个项目变得比他想象的要大得多
27 years later, it is much, much bigger than he ever dreamed it would be.

374
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,760
到 1991 年秋季 托瓦兹发布了 10000 行代码
By the fall of 1991, Torvalds releases 10,000 lines of code,

375
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,560
世界各地的人们开始评头论足
and people around the world start offering comments,

376
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,000
然后进行优化、添加和修改代码
then tweaks, additions, edits.

377
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,800
对于今天的开发人员来说似乎很正常
That might seem totally normal to you as a developer today,

378
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,720
但请记住 在那个时候
but remember, at that time,

379
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,560
开放协作操作系统是对微软、苹果和 IBM
open collaboration like that was a moral affront to the whole proprietary system

380
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,000
这些靠专利盈利的公司的精神侮辱
that Microsoft, Apple, and IBM had done so well by.

381
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,920
随后这种开放性被奉上神坛
And then that openness gets enshrined.

382
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,920
托瓦兹将 Linux 置于 GNU 通用公共许可证之下
Torvalds places Linux under the GNU general public license.

383
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,920
曾经保障斯托尔曼的 GNU 系统自由的许可证
The license that had kept Stallman's GNU system free

384
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,840
现在也将保障 Linux 的自由
was now going to keep Linux free, too.

385
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,800
GPL 许可基本上能永远保证软件的自由和开放性
The importance of that move to incorporate GPL,

386
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,880
它的重要性被怎么强调都不过分
basically preserving the freedom and openness of the software forever, cannot be overstated.

387
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,880
Vaughan-Nichols 解释道
Vaughan-Nichols explains.

388
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,040
事实上 根据 Linux 所遵循的许可协议
In fact, by the license that it's under,

389
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,600
即 GPL 第 2 版
which is called GPL version 2,

390
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,480
如果你想贩卖 Linux 或者向全世界展示它
you have to share the code

391
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,320
你必须与他人共享代码
if you're going to try to sell it or present it to the world,

392
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,040
所以如果你对其做了一些改进
so that if you make an improvement,

393
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,920
仅仅给别人使用打包的代码是不够的
it's not enough just to give someone the improvement.

394
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:49,000
你必须和他们分享这些变化的所有细节代码
You actually have to share with them the nuts and bolts of all those changes.

395
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,120
然后这些改进足够好时 也许就会被 Linux 所吸收
Then they are adapted into Linux if they're good enough.

396
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,320
事实证明 这种公开的方式极具吸引力
That public approach proved massively attractive.

397
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,040
埃里克·雷蒙德是这场运动的早期传道者之一 Eric Raymond, one of the early evangelists of the movement

398
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,960
他在他那篇著名的文章中写道：
wrote in his famous essay that,

399
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,840
“微软和苹果这样的公司一直在试图建造软件大教堂
"Corporations like Microsoft and Apple have been trying to build software cathedrals,

400
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,480
而 Linux 及类似的软件则提供了一个
while Linux and its kind were offering a great babbling bazaar

401
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
由不同议程和方法组成的巨大集市
of different agendas and approaches.

402
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,120
集市比大教堂有趣多了 ”
The bazaar was a lot more fun than the cathedral."

403
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,640
我认为在那个时候 真正吸引人们的是 
I think at the time, what attracted people

404
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,320
他们终于可以掌控这个属于他们的世界了
is that they were going to be in control of their own world.

405
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,680
Stormy Peters 是一位行业分析师
Stormy Peters is an industry analyst,

406
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,200
也是自由和开源软件的倡导者
and an advocate for free and open source software.

407
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,880
当开源软件第一次出现的时候 所有的操作系统都是专有的
When open source software first came out, the OS was all proprietary.

408
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,400
如果不使用专有软件 你甚至不能添加打印机
You couldn't even add a printer without going through proprietary software.

409
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,040
不能添加耳机
You couldn't add a headset.

410
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,840
不能自己开发一个小型硬件设备
You couldn't develop a small hardware device of your own,

411
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,440
然后让它在你的笔记本电脑上运行
and make it work with your laptop.

412
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,440
你甚至不能放入 DVD 并复制它
You couldn't even put in a DVD and copy it,

413
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,200
因为你不能改变软件
because you couldn't change the software.

414
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,920
即使你拥有这张 DVD 你也无法改变它的内容
Even if you owned the DVD, you couldn't copy it.

415
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,720
你无法掌控你购买的硬件 / 软件系统
You had no control over this hardware/software system that you'd bought.

416
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,800
你不能从中创造出任何新的、更大的、更好的东西
You couldn't create anything new and bigger and better out of it.

417
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,240
这就是为什么开源操作系统在一开始就如此重要
That's why an open source operating system was so important at the beginning.

418
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,240
我们需要一个开源协作环境 在那里我们可以构建更大更好的东西
We needed an open source collaborative environment where we could build bigger and better things.

419
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,560
请注意 Linux 并不是一个纯粹的平等乌托邦
Mind you, Linux isn't a purely egalitarian utopia.

420
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,960
林纳斯·托瓦兹并没有负责批准所有对内核的修改
Linus Torvalds doesn't approve everything that goes into the kernel,

421
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,280
但他主导了内核的变更
but he does preside over its changes.

422
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,720
他安排了十几个人来管理内核的不同部分
He's installed a dozen or so people below him to manage different parts of the kernel.

423
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,360
这些人也会信任自己下面的人 以此类推 形成信任金字塔
They, in turn, trust people under themselves, and so on, in a pyramid of trust.

424
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,080
变化可能来自任何地方 但它们都经过了判断和策划
Changes might come from anywhere, but they're all judged and curated.

425
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,200
然而 考虑到到林纳斯的 DIY 项目一开始是多么的简陋和随意
It is amazing, though, to think how humble, and kind of random,

426
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,840
这项成就令人十分惊讶
Linus' DIY project was to begin with.

427
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,200
他完全不知道自己就是这一切中的卢克·天行者
He didn't have a clue he was the Luke Skywalker figure in all this.

428
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,520
当时他只有 21 岁 已经编程了半辈子
He was just 21, and had been programming half his life.

429
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,040
不过当魔盒第一次被打开时 人们开始给他反馈
But this was the first time the silo opened up, and people started giving him feedback.

430
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,240
几十个 然后几百个 成千上万的贡献者
Dozens, then hundreds, and thousands of contributors.

431
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,000
有了这样的众包基础 Linux 很快就开始成长 而且成长得很快
With crowdsourcing like that, it doesn't take long before Linux starts growing. Really growing.

432
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,080
甚至最终引起了微软的注意
It even finally gets noticed by Microsoft.

433
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,760
他们的首席执行官史蒂夫·鲍尔默将 Linux 称为是
Their CEO, Steve Ballmer, called Linux, and I quote,

434
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,280
“一种癌症 从知识产权的角度来看 它传染了任何它接触的东西”
"A cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches."

435
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,120
Steven Levy 将会描述 Ballmer 的立场
Steven Levy describes where Ballmer was coming from.

436
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,840
一旦微软真正巩固了它的垄断地位 
Once Microsoft really solidified its monopoly,

437
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,720
而且它也确实被联邦法院判定为垄断
and indeed it was judged in federal court as a monopoly,

438
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,760
他们将会对任何可能对其构成威胁的事情做出强烈反应
anything that could be a threat to that, they reacted very strongly to.

439
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,760
他们很自然的将自由软件看成是一种癌症
So of course, the idea that free software would be emerging,

440
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:44,040
因为微软要通过软件来赚钱
when they were charging for software, they saw as a cancer.

441
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,000
他们试图提出一个知识产权理论
They tried to come up with an intellectual property theory

442
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,640
来解释为什么开源对消费者不利
about why this was going to be bad for consumers.

443
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,120
Linux 在不断传播 微软也开始担心起来
Linux was spreading, and Microsoft was worried.

444
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,960
到了 2006 年 Linux 成为仅次于 Windows 的第二大常用操作系统
By 2006, Linux would become the second most widely used operating system after Windows,

445
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,560
约有 5000 名开发者在世界各地开发它
with about 5,000 developers working on it worldwide.

446
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
5000 名开发者
Five thousand.

447
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,320
还记得比尔·盖茨给苹果公司的备忘录吗？
Remember that memo that Bill Gates sent to Apple,

448
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,960
在那份备忘录中 他向苹果公司的员工们论述了与他人合作的重要性
the one where he's lecturing them about the importance of partnering with other people?

449
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,160
事实证明 开源将把伙伴关系的概念提升到一个全新的水平
Turns out, open source would take that idea of partnerships to a whole new level,

450
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,080
这是比尔·盖茨从未预见到的
in a way Bill Gates would have never foreseen.

451
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,320
我们一直在谈论操作系统之间的大战
We've been talking about these huge battles for the OS,

452
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,640
但是到目前为止 无名英雄和开发者们还没有完全介入战场
but so far, the unsung heroes, the developers, haven't fully made it onto the battlefield.

453
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,600
在下集中 情况就不同了
That changes next time, on Command Line Heroes.

454
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,080
第二集讲的还是操作系统大战 关于 Linux 崛起的第二部分 In episode two, part two of the OS wars, it's the rise of Linux.

455
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,920
资本们醒悟过来 认识到了开发人员的重要性
Businesses wake up, and realize the importance of developers.

456
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,240
这些开源反叛者变得越来越强大
These open source rebels grow stronger,

457
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,880
战场从桌面转移到了服务器领域
and the battlefield shifts from the desktop to the server room.

458
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,600
这里有商业间谍活动、新的英雄人物
There's corporate espionage, new heroes,

459
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,560
还有科技史上最不可思议的改变
and the unlikeliest change of heart in tech history.

460
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,560
这一切都在操作系统大战的后半集内达到了高潮
It all comes to a head in the concluding half of the OS wars.

461
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,880
在这一季剩下的时间里 我们将参观最新的战场
Over the rest of the season, we're visiting the latest battlefields,

462
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:17,080
相互争斗的版图 这里是下一代的代码英雄留下印记的地方
the up-for-grab territories where the next generation of Command Line Heroes are making their mark.

463
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,040
代码英雄是一款红帽公司原创的博客节目
Command Line Heroes is an original podcast from Red Hat.
