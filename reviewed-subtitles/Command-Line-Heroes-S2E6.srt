1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,970
如果你把从人类历史早期
If you take all human data

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,010
到 2003 年创造的所有数据计算在内
created from the dawn of time to 2003

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,470
你将得到大约 500 万 GB 的数据
you'd get about five million gigabytes of data

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,370
我们昨天创造了多少 GB 数据
How many gigabytes of data did we create yesterday

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,370
哦 天哪
Oh gosh

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,060
10 万
100,000

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,260
可能是 500 万 GB 数据
Like five million gigabytes

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:23,280
How many gigabytes of data did we create yesterday

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,700
我们在昨天一天之内创造了多少 GB 的数据
How many gigabytes of data did we create yesterday

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:26,720
我们在昨天一天之内创造了多少 GB 的数据
in one day? 10 million gigabytes?

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,440
一千万 GB？
in one day? 10 million gigabytes?

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,280
我不太知道 可能是
I would say, I don't know, like

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,820
200 万 GB 数据
two million maybe

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,250
也许一天就有 100 万 GB 数据
Maybe a million gigabytes in a day

15
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,000
答案是 超过 25 亿 GB 数据
Answer? More than 2.5 billion

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,760
答案是 超过 25 亿 GB 数据
Answer? More than 2.5 billion
哇哦
Oh wow. Wow.

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,400
25 亿? 对的 25 亿
2.5 billion? Billion!
哇哦
Oh wow. Wow.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:44,592
25 亿? 对的 25 亿
2.5 billion? Billion!

19
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:46,592
25 亿? 对的 25 亿
2.5 billion? Billion!
所以 我们已经打破了世界纪录
So, we already beat the world record

20
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:46,750
25 亿? 对的 25 亿
2.5 billion? Billion!

21
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,105
25 亿? 对的 25 亿
2.5 billion? Billion!
那可真是很多个 G 啊 
That's a lot of gigabytes

22
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:48,233
那可真是很多个 G 啊 
That's a lot of gigabytes

23
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:50,080
我都不敢相信那有这么多的数据
That's a lot of data right there. I don't believe it.

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,700
在 2016 年 我们的年度在线数据流量
In 2016, our annual data traffic online

25
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,930
首次超过了 1ZB
passed one zetabyte for the first time

26
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,620
一个 ZB 是 1000^7 字节
That's one sextillion bytes

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,380
好 记住这个数字了吗
if it helps. Okay, got that number in your head?

28
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,130
现在把它乘以 3
Now triple it

29
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,710
因为那是我们将在 2021 年拥有的数据量
because that's how much data we'll have by 2021

30
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,790
我知道 大脑不是以 ZB 为单位进行思考的
I know, the brain wasn't made to think in zetabytes

31
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,200
但请你至少暂时记住这个数
but just hold onto this one little fact for a second

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,820
我们的 IP 流量将在五年内翻三番
Our IP traffic will triple in five years
注：这里的 IP 指 TCP/IP 中的 IP，而非知识产权和品牌相关的概念

33
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,440
这是数据的洪流 而我们正处于其中
It's a data flood and we're in the middle of it

34
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,410
在刚过去的一分钟里
That last minute that went by

35
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,330
人们发出了 1600 万条短信
people sent 16 million text messages

36
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,640
与此同时 在我说出这句话的时间里
and in the time it took me to say that sentence

37
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,310
谷歌处理了 20 万条搜索
Google processed 200,000 searches

38
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,730
如果我们能在数据洪流来临时
Hidden inside that data flood are patterns

when the flood comes in
*这部分的语序在翻译时遭到了调整，因此中文和英文文本无法一句句对应。

44
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,050
我是 Saron Yitbarek 这里是《代码英雄》
I'm Saron Yitbarek and this is Command Line Heroes

45
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,170
一款红帽公司原创的播客节目
an original podcast from Red Hat

46
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,240
浪潮近在眼前
The tidal waves are on the horizon

47
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,880
这里是第二季第六集 数据大爆炸
This is episode 6 of season 2, the data flood

48
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,130
我们如何处理如此大量的数据
So, how do we handle such enormous amounts of data

49
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,770
采集到这些数据后 我们如何利用它们
How will we make use of that data once it's captured

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,340
大数据将为我们解决一些最复杂的问题
Big data is going to solve some of our most complicated problems

51
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,190
如何管理交通 如何种植粮食
How we manage traffic, how we grow food

52
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,730
如何向需要的人提供物资
How we deliver supplies to those in need

53
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,180
但这一切的前提是 我们必须弄清楚该怎么使用这些数据
But only once we figure out how to work with all that data

54
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,370
以及该怎么在短得不能再短的时间内完成对它们的处理
how to process it, and at breakneck speed

55
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,810
通过获取更多的数据
By having more data

56
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,650
我们可以深入到这些子群体
we can drill down into these sub-groups

57
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,810
这些细节 而这是
these particulars, and these details

58
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,510
我们以前从来没有过的方式
in ways that we never could before

59
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,750
Kenneth Cukier 是《经济学人》的高级编辑
Kenneth Cukier is a senior editor at The Economist

60
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,560
他也是科技播客《Babbage》的主持人
and he's also the Saron Yitbarek of their tech podcast called Babbage

61
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,770
这并不是说我们以前无法收集数据 我们可以
It's not to say that we couldn't collect the data before. We could

62
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,300
但这真的 真的很昂贵
it just was really, really expensive

63
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,770
真正的革命性突破是 我们使数据搜集
The real revolution is that we can collect this data

64
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,790
变得十分容易 现在收集数据的成本极低
very easily. It's very inexpensive

65
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,660
而且处理起来也超级简单
and the processing is super simple

66
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,650
因为都是由电脑完成的
because it's all done by a computer

67
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,040
这已经成为我们这个时代的巨大革命
This has become the huge revolution of our era

68
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,610
它可能是现代生活
and it is probably the most defining

69
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,890
最显著的特征
aspect of modern life

70
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,480
在未来几十年甚至下个世纪都会如此
and will be for the next several decades, if not the next century

71
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,130
这也是大数据如此重要的原因
That's why big data's such a big deal

72
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,820
历史可以提醒我们 这种变化是翻天覆地的
A little history can remind us how radical that change has been

73
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,930
想想看 4000 年前
Think about it, 4,000 years ago

74
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,370
我们把所有的数据都刻在了干泥板上
we were scratching all our data into dried slabs of mud

75
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,400
这些泥板很重
These clay disks were heavy

76
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,380
泥板被烤干后 刻在其中的数据
The data that is imprinted in them once they're baked

77
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,840
就无法更改 从古至今
can't be changed. All of these features

78
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,580
信息处理
of how information was

79
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,170
存储 传输 创建的方式
processed, stored, transferred, created

80
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,980
都发生了变化 对吗
has changed, right

81
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,720
时代巨变 大约在 1450 年
Changed big time. Around the year 1450

82
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,480
印刷机的发明
you get the first information revolution

83
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,660
带来了第一次信息革命
with the invention of the printing press

84
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,000
今天 我们也迎来了一场革命
And today, we have our own revolution

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,400
现在的存储介质很轻巧
It's lightweight

86
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,980
信息的修改变得极度简单 借助现有的处理器
It can be changed super simply because we can just use

87
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,580
我们只需要使用删除键就能修改我们所拥有的信息实例
the delete key and change the instantiation of the information that we have

88
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,180
无论那是储存在磁带上
in whether it's the magnetic tape or in the transition of the electronic

89
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,690
还是晶体管的变化里
transistors and the processors that we have

90
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,580
我们可以以光速传输数据
We can transport it at the speed of light

91
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,890
不用携带什么泥板
unlike say a clay disk that you have to carry

92
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,170
在 15 世纪 借助印刷机 大量的数据得以传播
The printing press levelled up our understanding of things

93
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,090
这些知识提升了人们对事物的认识 并促成了启蒙运动
with the 15th-century flood of data that ushered in the enlightenment

94
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,890
今天 大数据可以再次提升我们的知识水平
Today, big data can level us up again

95
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,000
但我们必须要想办法充分利用这些数据
But only if we figure out how to take advantage of all that data

96
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,530
唯有修好大坝 备好轮机
Only if we build the dams and the turbines

97
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,530
才能让浪潮为人所用
that will put the flood to work

98
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,340
当下 人们远没有做到
There is a huge gap between what is possible

99
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,660
对数据的充分利用
and what companies and individuals and organizations are doing

100
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,690
这一点非常重要 因为我们已经看到
That's really important because we could already see

101
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,870
数据中存在这种潜在的价值
that there's this latent value in the data

102
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,870
而收集 存储和处理数据的成本
and that the cost of collecting, storing, and processing the data

103
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,980
在近百年来 乃至于近十年来
has really dropped down considerably to where it was

104
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,740
已经显著地降低了
of course, a hundred years ago but even just ten years ago

105
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,440
这很振奋人心 但问题是 我们在文化上
That's really exciting. But the problem is that, culturally

106
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,530
在我们的组织流程上
and in our organizational processes

107
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,140
甚至我们的 CFO 和 CIO 们拨给
and even in the budgets that our CFOs and our CIOs

108
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,020
相关方面的预算中 并不重视这种价值
allot to data, we're not there yet

109
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,770
想着这种事肯定让人极度沮丧
Super frustrating when you think about it

110
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,790
启蒙运动在敲门 却无人应答
Enlightenment knocking at the door and nobody's answering

111
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,540
然而 我们不回答的部分原因是
Part of the reason we're not answering though

112
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,720
门后到底是谁
is that, well, who's actually behind the door

113
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,190
这些数据能带来什么
What's all this data gonna deliver

114
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,400
Kenneth 认为 某些公司不采用大数据
Kenneth figures the newness of big data

115
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,350
乃是因为它太过于新奇
keeps some companies from taking that leap

116
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,330
一旦你收集了大量数据后 你能拿它干什么
What is the value of the data once you collect a lot of it

117
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,090
我就直说吧
The most honest answer is

118
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,250
只有傻子才会以为自己知道
if you think you know, you're a fool

119
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,200
你绝对无法设想你今天
Because you can never identify today

120
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,240
收集到的数据明天能拿来做什么用
all the ways with which we're going to put the data to uses tomorrow

121
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,660
重点在于要把数据攥在手里
The most important thing is to have the data

122
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,920
并以开放的思想对待所有可以使用的方式
and to have an open mind in all the ways that it can be used

123
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,610
如果我们按照 Kenneth 说的那样 以正确的方式对待大数据
What Kenneth's envisioning if we get big data right

124
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,740
我们将会发现一切的全新可能性
is a wholesale transformation of our attitudes towards what's possible

125
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,490
等待我们的将是一个人人 - 而不只是数据科学家
A world where everybody, not just data scientists

126
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,370
都能洞察趋势、分析细节的世界
can see the potential and gain insight

127
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,020
如果我们能意识到 这个世界是
By understanding that the world is one

128
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,420
可以通过收集经验证据
in which we can collect empirical evidence about it

129
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,940
来理解、改变和改善的
in order to understand it, and in order to change it, and improve it

130
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,390
并且可以用一种自动化的方式进行改善
and that improvements can happen in an automated fashion

131
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,050
我们将会得到看待它的全新角度
we will see the world in a different way

132
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,280
我个人认为 现如今 在世界各地
and I think that's the really interesting change that's happening now

133
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,710
上至政策制定者 、下至星巴克咖啡师
culturally or psychologically around the world where

134
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,670
都在经历这种引人深思的文化上或心理上的变化
policy makers and business people and Starbucks baristas

135
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,700
各行各业的人都有点数据基因
Everyone in all walks of life sort of have the data gene

136
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,600
就像是被感染了似的 现在
They got it. They've sort of gotten the inoculation and now

137
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,580
无论他们专注于什么方面 他们都以大数据的方式思考
everywhere they look, they think in a data mindset

138
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,850
Kenneth Cukier 给我们讲了一个简短的故事来展现
Kenneth Cukier told us a quick story to illustrate

139
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,830
这种新数据思维方式的力量
the power of that new data mindset

140
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,300
微软的一些研究人员开始着手研究胰腺癌问题
Some researchers at Microsoft began thinking about pancreatic cancer

141
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,580
人们发现胰腺癌往往为时已晚
People often find out about pancreatic cancer too late

142
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,090
早期发现可以挽救生命
and early detection could save lives

143
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,600
因此 研究人员开始询问这些患者
So, the researchers began asking

144
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,540
在开始搜索有关胰腺癌的信息之前几个月
before these patients start searching for information on pancreatic cancer

145
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,090
他们搜索了什么
what were they searching for in the previous few months

146
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,330
而早在发现前数年 他们又搜索了什么 研究人员开始
And in the previous years. They began looking for clues

147
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,220
寻找埋藏在所有
buried inside all that search data

148
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,520
搜索数据中的线索和模式
They began looking for patterns

149
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,730
他们有了重大发现 通过分析患者在最终开始搜索“胰腺癌”
They struck pay dirt. They saw that they can identify patterns in the search terms

150
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,230
之前的这段时间中所搜索的关键词 他们识别出了一套规律
leading up to the moment where people started searching for pancreatic cancer

151
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,590
可以非常准确地预测搜索者是否患有胰腺癌
that predicted very accurately that people had pancreatic cancer

152
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,830
在这里，我们能学到一点：想象力与
The lesson here is that by using their imagination in terms of

153
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,370
数据中潜在规律的结合 是可以挽救生命的
the latent knowledge inside of data, they can save lives

154
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,550
他们现在所要做的就是找到一种方法
All they need now to do is to find a way to instrument

155
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,690
通过方法来解释这一发现
through policy this finding

156
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,510
这样当人们在搜索这些术语时
so that when people are searching for these terms

157
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,830
他们可以以一种微妙的方式干预 说
they can intervene in a subtle way to say

158
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,320
“你可能要去诊所检查一下”
You might wanna go to a healthcare clinic and get this checked out

159
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,200
像这样使用数据 就能救人于水火之中
If they start doing that, people's lives will be saved

160
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,770
研究人员偶然发现的是一种新的癌症筛查方式
What the researchers stumbled upon is a new form of cancer screening

161
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,840
通过这种方法 患者可以提前一个月得知自己可能患癌
a process that could alert patients month earlier

162
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,370
利用数据不仅仅是一个利润或效率最大化的问题
 Making use of data isn't just a question of maximizing profits or efficiency

163
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,450
它的意义远不止于此
It's about so much more than that

164
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,460
对于人类而言 这些数据中确确实实存在着大量的潜在利好
Hiding in all that data are real, enormous positives for humankind

165
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,360
抗拒使用大数据可能只是自欺欺人
If we don't use that data, we could be cheating ourselves

166
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,320
接下来 我们要关注的是
It's that epic struggle to put data to work

167
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,480
这场将数据投入工作的持久战
that we're focusing on next

168
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,180
哈佛医学院的波士顿儿童医院
Boston Children's Hospital at Harvard Medical School

169
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,390
去年完成了 26000 多台手术
performed more than 26,000 surgeries last year

170
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,560
进行约 25 万人次的
Kids walk through their doors

171
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,070
儿童放射检查
for about a quarter million radiological exams

172
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,610
医护人员的表现令人称道
The staff is doing incredible work

173
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,300
但有一个巨大的障碍挡在他们面前
but there's a huge roadblock standing in their way

174
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,290
在医院的环境中 尤其是
A lot of the problems that we have in a hospital environment

175
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,450
作为医生 我们经常会遇到难以获取数据的问题
especially as a physician, is how to get access to the data

176
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,070
这位是 Ellen Grant 医生
That's Dr. Ellen Grant

177
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,080
她是波士顿儿童医院的儿科神经放射科医生
She's a pediatric neuroradiologist at Boston Children's

178
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,850
她在诊疗时依靠访问数据和分析医学图像
and she depends on accessing data and analyzing medical images

179
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,950
如果没有专门设置的环境
It's not simple to get access into

180
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,660
想要对 PACS 存档里存储的图像进行
say a PACS archive where the images are stored

181
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,170
额外的数据分析绝非易事
to do additional data analysis unless you set up an environment and that's

182
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,010
当你在一个只提供了普通的医院电脑的读片室里时
not easy to do when you're in a reading room where there are just

183
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,110
要做到这一点并不容易
standard hospital PCs provided

184
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,250
获取数据实际上是有障碍的
There's a barrier to actually get to the data

185
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,430
其实许多医院都会大量抛弃数据
Hospitals actually dump a lot of their data

186
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,290
因为存储它们的成本实在过于高昂
because they can't afford to store it

187
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,180
这部分数据就像这样丢失了
So, that data's just lost

188
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,940
像 Grant 这样的放射科医生可能是第一批
Radiologists like Dr. Grant may have been the first group of doctors

189
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,160
因为数据实在太多而感到沮丧的医务人员
to feel the frustration of data overload

190
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,700
当医院走向数字化后 他们开始创造大量的数据
When they went digital, they began creating enormous amounts of data

191
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,930
很快 这个量就大到无法处理了
and that quickly became impossible to handle

192
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,310
我 作为一名临床医生 在读片室里的时候
I, as a clinician, in the reading room

193
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:49,210
希望能将所有复杂的分析工作在研究环境中做完
wanted to be able to do all the fancy analysis that could be done in a research environment

194
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:54,040
但我无法随便就从 PACS 中拿出来图像
But there's no way to easily get images off of the PACS

195
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,970
拿到一些可以进行分析的地方
and get them to some place where the analysis could be done

196
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,970
再拿回到我手里
and get them back into my hands

197
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,500
顺便说一句 PACS 就是医院存储其图像的数据仓库
PACS by the way are what hospitals call the data banks that store their images

198
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,694
Grant 医生知道有一些工具
Dr. Grant knew there were tools

199
00:11:06,694 --> 00:11:09,640
可以让这些保存图像的 PACS 发挥更大的功能
 that could make those PACS of images more functional

200
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,820
但成本太高
but costs were prohibitive

201
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,661
随着机器学习和 AI 时代的到来
As we're entering into this era of machine learning and AI,  

202
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:19,410
数据的生产量将会日渐加大
there's more of that gonna happen

203
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,990
我们会需要更多计算资源来进行这类
that we need these larger computational resources to really start to do

204
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,810
大规模的数据库分析
the large database analysis we wanna do

205
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,400
数据已经堆积如山了
The data's been piling up

206
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,700
但处理能力却没有相称的增长
but not so much the processing

207
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,460
在这一前提下 对数据的彻底处理将变得遥不可及
On premise data processing would be out of reach

208
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,880
而复杂 昂贵的超级计算机
And elaborate, expensive supercomputers

209
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
并不是医院的选择
aren't an option for hospitals

210
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,960
Grant 医生深感沮丧
Dr. Grant became deeply frustrated

211
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,290
我们能不能想出一个更好的办法 让我把数据拿到这里来
Can't we figure out a better way for me to just get data over here

212
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,400
分析一下 然后放回去 这样我就可以
analyze it, get it back so I can do it

213
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,700
在会诊的时候 一边解释临床图像 一边把分析做完
at the console where I'm interpreting clinical images

214
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,480
因为我希望可以在会诊上展示数据
cause I wanna have that data

215
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,550
在此同时进行快速分析 我可不想在
there and analyzed there quickly, I don't wanna have to

216
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,510
在不同的电脑之间挪来挪去 记住所有的代码
move to different computers and memorize all this line code

217
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,160
这不是我的工作 我的工作是
when that's not my job. My job is

218
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,380
理解非常复杂的医学疾病 并把
trying to understand very complex medical diseases and

219
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,960
相关的事实真相记在脑子里 我想
keep all those facts in my head. So I wanted to

220
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,380
我想专注于我的技术领域 在此同时
keep my focus on where my skill set was but exploit

221
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:20,400
利用计算机领域的新兴技术 而不必过于深入钻研
what is emerging in the computational side without having to dive that deep into it

222
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,990
Grant 和世界各地的放射科医生们需要的是一种方法
What Dr. Grant and radiologists around the world

223
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:30,050
只要点击图像就能运行详细分析
needed was a way to click on imagery run detailed analysis

224
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,060
并让这一切都发生在云端
and have it all happen on the cloud

225
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,370
这样医院就不必建立自己的服务器场地
so the hospital didn't have to build their own server farm

226
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,040
也不必把医务人员变成程序员
and didn't have to turn the medical staff into programmers

227
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,720
他们需要一种方法来使他们的数据尽可能地拯救生命
They needed a way to make their data save all the lives it could

228
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,110
这正是 Grant 医生
and so, that's exactly what Dr. Grant

229
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,810
和几位代码英雄决定去做的事
and a few command line heroes decided to build

230
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,770
Grant 在波士顿儿童医院的团队
Dr. Grant's team at Boston Children's Hospital

231
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,150
正在与红帽和马萨诸塞州开放云（MOC）合作
worked with Red Hat and the Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC)

232
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,150
关于 MOC 的更多内容稍后再说
More on the MOC a little later

233
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,273
首先 我们需要请出 Rudolph Pienaar
First though, here's Rudolph Pienaar

234
00:13:06,273 --> 00:13:08,570
他是医院的一名生物化学工程师
a biomedical engineer at the hospital

235
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,570
来描述一下他们的解决方案
describing their solution

236
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,890
它是一个开源的、基于容器的成像平台
It's an open source, container-based imaging platform

237
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,880
它完全是在云端运行的
It's all run on the cloud, too

238
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,930
所以你不受医院本身计算能力的限制
So you're not limited by the computing power at the hospital itself

239
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,900
他们称这一作品为 ChRIS
They call their creation ChRIS

240
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,960
ChRIS 有一个后台数据库 其实就是一个 Django Python 机器
There's a backend database that's a Django Python machine really

241
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,070
它可以跟踪用户
and that keeps track of users

242
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,530
并跟踪这些用户使用过的数据以及分析结果
It keeps track of the data they've processed. It keeps track of results

243
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,810
围绕这个数据库  有大量的服务群
Then there are a whole bunch of constellation of services around this database

244
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,620
这些服务都是作为独立的实例存在于容器中
that all exist as their own instances in containers

245
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,760
它们处理与医院资源的通信
These deal with communicating with hospital resources like databases

246
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,500
比如与医院数据库的通信
They deal with, you know

247
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,540
这些服务从资源中提取复杂的数据
the intricacies of pulling data from these resources and then

248
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,100
将其推送给云端的 或者另一个实验室的
pushing them out to other services that exist on a cloud

249
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,780
或者别的什么地方的其他服务处理
or another lab or whatever it might be

250
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,050
在计算数据的地方
On the place where data is computed

251
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,360
有 Kubernetes 之类的编排服务
there's all these services like Kubernetes

252
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,200
以及你需要使用的分析程序
the schedule, the actual analysis of the data that you want to be doing

253
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
数据处理结束之后 结果就会被发送回来
Then, pulling it back again

254
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,360
对于 Grant 医生来说 ChRIS 成像平台
For Dr. Grant, the ChRIS imaging platform

255
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,820
是一种让数据活起来的方法
is a way to make data come to life

256
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,370
更重要的是 这种数据处理方式能让她成为更好的医生
More than that, it's a way for data to make her a better doctor

257
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,670
优秀的医生之所以优秀 是因为
What makes a person a good physician is the

258
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,820
他们在一生中积累了丰富的从业经验
experience they've had over a lifetime of practicing

259
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,980
如果我们能把这一点融入到
But if I can kind of embody that into the

260
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,030
数据分析中 以此来获得更多的信息
data analysis and access more of that information

261
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,160
我们就能知道得更多 
 we just all know more and can

262
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,330
并更有效地整合这些经验 例如 
combine the information better. So for example

263
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,040
我对特定病患的特定受伤方式的认识
I have a perception of what a certain

264
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,340
我对特定病患的特定受伤方式的认识
pattern of injury looks like in a certain patient population

265
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:52,220
取决于我的从医经验和对这些经验的整体理解
 built on my Gestalt understanding from the memories that I have

266
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,930
现在 我可以根据真实数据
I can now actually create probability maps

267
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,200
创建受伤症状分布的概率图
of their distributions and

268
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,740
并将其公之于众
inform everybody based on real data

269
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,430
我也可以寻找有相似模式的患者
or I can look for similar patients who had similar patterns

270
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,390
并告诉他们在接受治疗时 什么对他们最有效
and say what works best with them when they were treated

271
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,000
以便更接近精准医疗
to try to get closer to precision medicine

272
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,160
整合大量的数据
Integrating the large amount of data

273
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,900
尝试探索我们过去的知 并尽你所能
and trying to exploit our past knowledge and to best inform how to

274
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,320
点明治疗病人的最佳方式
treat any individual the best you can

275
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,180
这对被送到医院的孩子意味着什么
What does that mean for the children that are brought to the hospital

276
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,960
Grant 医生说 ChRIS 平台
Dr. Grant says the ChRIS platform

277
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,480
能提供更有针对性的诊断和更个性化的护理
delivers more targeted diagnoses and more individualized care

278
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,840
如果我们拥有更复杂的数据库
If we have more complex databases

279
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,290
我们就能更好地理解信息之间繁杂的相互作用
we can understand complex interactions better

280
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,050
因此就能更好地指导每个患者
and hopefully guide individual patients better

281
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,470
我认为 ChRIS 就像是我
I think of ChRIS basically as my

282
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,290
进入超级大脑的接口
portal into multiple accessory lobes

283
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,350
它能让我比平时更聪明
so I can be a lot smarter than I can on my own

284
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,650
因为我不能一次把所有数据保存在我的大脑中
‘cause I cannot keep all this data in my brain at one time

285
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,250
当赌注如此沉重时
When the stakes are this high

286
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,470
我们要突破人类大脑的极限
we wanna push past the limits of the human brain

287
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,720
这位是 Máirín Duffy
Here's Máirín Duffy

288
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,540
她是红帽团队中的设计师 她让 ChRIS 成为现实
She's a designer on the Red Hat team that makes ChRIS happen

289
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,930
而根据个人经验 她知道这件事其中的风险
and she knows from personal experience what's at stake

290
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,380
我父亲中风了
My father had a stroke

291
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:23,790
所以我一直作为病人家属等待医疗技术诊断
so I've been there sort of in the patient's family side of waiting for medical technology

292
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,860
因为当一个人中风
‘cause when someone has a stroke

293
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,380
并被送到医院之后 医务人员必须弄清楚是哪种类型的中风
they bring you in the hospital and they have to figure out what type of stroke it is

294
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,290
根据中风类型 有不同的治疗方法
Based on the type, there's different treatments

295
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,040
如果使用了错误的治疗方案 就可能发生极其糟糕的事
If you give the wrong treatment, then really bad things can happen

296
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,790
所以 在这种情况下 你能越快地把病人送来做核磁共振
So, the faster you can get the patient in for an MRI

297
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,640
就能越快地得到治疗方案
the faster you can interpret the results in that situation

298
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,250
速度越快就有可能挽救他们的生命
The faster you can potentially save their life

299
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,740
想想看 仅仅是
Just think about just the fact of

300
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,830
把图像处理从云端推送出来
getting that image processing pushed out of the cloud

301
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,760
并行化处理 就能让它快很多
parallelized, make it so much faster

302
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,740
这样就能将这个过程从几小时 几天 缩短到几分钟
So instead of being hours or days, it's minutes

303
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,160
医学可能正迎来一个新的拐点
Medicine may be arriving at a new inflection point

304
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,310
一个不是由药理学驱动 而是由计算机科学驱动的拐点
One not driven by pharmacology, but by computer science

305
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,560
另外 想想像 ChRIS 这种东西的拓展性
Also, think about the scalability of something like ChRIS

306
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,390
发展中国家的医生也可以受益于
You could have doctors in developing countries benefiting

307
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,240
波士顿儿童医院的专业知识和数据集
from the expertise and data sets at Boston Children's Hospital

308
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,020
任何有手机服务的人都可以通过网络访问
Anybody with cell service could access web-based computing and data

309
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,190
能够拯救生命的数据和计算结果
that might save lives

310
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,320
除了医学
Besides medicine

311
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,440
很多其他领域也可能出现类似的拐点
lots of other fields could be witnessing a similar inflection point

312
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:34,540
但前提是 人们得知道如何从自己的数据中找到隐藏信息
But only if they figure out how to make their data collections sing

313
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:40,060
为了做到这一点 他们需要探索一个全新的计算领域
To do that, they need to discover a whole new territory of computing

314
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,890
世界各地的人们都在学习如何利用数据
All around the world, we're learning to make use of our data

315
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,270
就像在波士顿儿童医院一样
Diverting those data floods towards our own goals

316
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,270
将数据洪流导向目标
like at Boston Children's Hospital

317
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,930
换句话说 我们在处理这些数据
In other words, we're processing that data

318
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,280
但我们之所以能做到这一点
But we can only do that

319
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,960
是因为新一代的云计算使之成为可能
because a new generation of cloud-based computing makes the processing possible 

320
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,980
对于像 ChRIS 这样的平台来说
For platforms like ChRIS

321
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,120
一个关键因素是
a key ingredient is that cloud-based computing

322
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,450
基于云计算的新型存储方式
is a new kind of storage

323
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,730
请记住 很多医院都会把收集到的数据扔掉
Remember that lots of hospitals throw out the data they gather

324
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,650
因为他们根本无法容纳所有数据
because they literally can't hold it all

325
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,980
这就是我想重点讨论的数据泛滥的最后一块拼图
That's what I wanna focus on as a last piece of the data flood puzzle

326
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,650
存储解决方案
The storage solution

327
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,610
对于 ChRIS 来说 存储解决方案是
For ChRIS, the storage solution

328
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,770
一个叫 Ceph 的开源项目
came in the form of an open source project called Ceph

329
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,970
它使用的马萨诸塞州开放云 就基于 Ceph
The Massachusetts Open Cloud, which ChRIS uses, depends on Ceph

330
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,840
我和 Ceph 的创造者 Sage Weil 聊了聊
So, I got chatting with its creator, Sage Weil

331
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,010
想了解更多关于像波士顿儿童医院这样的地方
to learn more about how places like Boston Children's

332
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,730
是如何以闪电般的速度处理海量数据的
can process enormous amounts of data in lightning time

333
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,220
以下是我与 Sage 的对话
Here's my conversation with Sage

334
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,250
我认为 第一个重要问题是
I think a great first question is

335
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,030
什么是 Ceph 它能做什么
what is Ceph and what does it do

336
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,920
当然 Ceph 是一个由软件定义的存储系统
Sure. Ceph is a software-defined storage system that

337
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,600
它允许你提供可靠的存储服务
allows you to provide a reliable storage service

338
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,550
并在不可靠的硬件上提供各种协议
providing various protocols across unreliable hardware

339
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,830
它的设计从开始就是满足可扩展性
It's designed from the ground up to be scalable

340
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,320
所以你可以拥有非常非常大的存储系统
so you can have very, very large storage systems

341
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
非常大的数据集
very large data sets

342
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,176
与此同时 系统对硬件故障和网络故障有优秀的容忍性
and you can make them available and tolerate hardware failures and network failures and so on

343
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:26,700
 所以即使出现了一些这类问题
and you can make them available and tolerate hardware failures and network failures and so on

344
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,080
存储中的数据仍然不会变得难于访问
without compromising availability

345
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,475
现在 数据太多了
Nowadays, there's just so much data

346
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:31,390
现在 数据太多了
Nowadays, there's just so much data
是的
Yes

347
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:31,500
如此大的工作量 要处理的东西实在是太多了
So much consumption. There's just so much to get a handle on
是的
Yes

348
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,610
如此大的工作量 要处理的东西实在是太多了
So much consumption. There's just so much to get a handle on

349
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,710
你认为这个解决方案出现得是时候吗
Do you feel like the timing of it was part of the need for the solution

350
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,970
是的 肯定是这样 在当时 行业中
Yes, definitely. At the time, it just seemed

351
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,920
这方面的严重不足是显而易见的
painfully obvious that there's this huge gap in the industry

352
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,960
没有开源的解决方案可以
There was no open source solution

353
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,360
解决可扩展的存储问题
that would address the scalable storage problem

354
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,260
所以 我们显然得造个轮子
So it was obvious that we needed to build something

355
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,010
考虑到我们每天要处理的数据量
When we're thinking about the amount of data we're dealing with

356
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,820
考虑到我们每天要处理的数据量
on a daily basis and the fact that it's

357
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,210
以及它将来只会越来越多
only growing, it's only getting bigger

358
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,760
越来越难管理的事实 你认为当今该怎么做
and harder to manage

359
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,140
越来越难管理的事实 你认为当今该怎么做
what do you see that's being worked on today

360
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,580
才能解决这种日益增长的需求
that will maybe address this growing need

361
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,330
我认为有几方面
I think there are sort of several pieces of it

362
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,540
一方面
The first thing is that

363
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,050
有令人难以置信的数据量正在产生
there's incredible amount of data being generated, of course

364
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,930
所以你需要可扩展的系统
so you need scalable systems that can

365
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,330
不仅可以在硬件和数据规模上进行扩展
scale not just in the amount of hardware and data that you're storing

366
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,900
而且 它的管理成本应该是一定的 至少应该基本固定
but also have a sort of fixed or nearly fixed operational overhead

367
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,467
嗯
Mm-hmm (affirmative)

368
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:30,250
你不会想就为每多 10PB 存储空间或类似的东西就多雇一个员工吧
You don't wanna pay another person per 10 petabytes or something like that

369
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,410
我认为这套系统在运维上也必须可扩展
So it has to be scalable. Operationally scalable, I guess would be the way to put it 

370
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:34,860
是的
Yeah

371
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,290
这是其中的一部分 我认为
That's part of it. I think also the

372
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,790
人们利用存储空间的方式也在改变
way that people interact with storage is changing as well, so

373
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,500
一开始 都是文件存储
In the beginning, it was all file storage

374
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,390
然后我们有了虚拟机的块存储 我觉得对象存储
and then we have block storage for VMs, object storage is sort of

375
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,980
在某种程度上是行业的重要趋势
I think, a critical trend in the industry

376
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,820
我认为 下一个阶段的目标
I think really the next phase of this is

377
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,440
并不局限于提供一个对象存储端点
not so much around just providing an object storage endpoint

378
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,880
并将数据存储在集群中
and being able to store data in one cluster

379
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,130
我们需要将解决方案进一步升级
but really taking this sort of the level up

380
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,650
好让它能管理集群的集群
and having clusters of clusters

381
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,240
抑或是对分布于不同地理位置的
geographically distributed mesh of cloud footprints or

382
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,840
云空间及私有数据中心储存空间
private datacenter footprints where data is stored

383
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,100
中的数据进行管理
and being able to manage the data that's distributed across those

384
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,850
例如说 你现在将数据写入一个位置
Maybe you write the data today in one location

385
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,250
随着时间的推移 你可能会想将数据分层到到其他位置
 you tier it off to somewhere else over time because it's

386
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,060
因为它更便宜 或者服务器离你更近 或者 一旦数据太老
cheaper, or it's closer, or the data's older

387
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,210
不会频繁使用了 你就需要将其移动到性能更低 容量更大的层次上
and you need to move it to a lower-performance, higher-capacity

388
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,580
以保证存储的成本较低
tier for pricing reasons

389
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,290
你可能也会为了遵循地方法规而移动数据
Dealing with things like compliance

390
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,450
在欧洲的一些地区接收数据时
so that when you ingest data in one

391
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,450
数据来源必须保持在
in Europe, it has to stay within

392
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:38,360
特定的政治边界内
certain political boundaries in order to comply with regulation

393
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,280
在某些行业 像 HIPAA 这样的东西
In certain industries, you have things like HIPAA that
HIPAA = 健康保险可携性和责任法案
1996 年在美国通过。规定了医疗和医保行业中个人身份信息应受保护。

394
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,530
限制了数据的移动方式 我认为 随着现代 IT 组织越来越多地
restricts the way that data's moved around. I think as modern IT organizations are

395
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:50,240
分布在不同的数据中心
increasingly spread across lots of different datacenters and lots of public clouds

396
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,890
公有和私有云中
and their own private cloud infrastructure

397
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,490
统一地 自动化地
being able to manage all this data and

398
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,020
管理它们的能力正变得越加重要
automate that management is becoming increasingly important

399
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,660
当你想到未来我们要如何管理和存储数据
When you think about how we're going to manage and store data

400
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,320
以及如何处理数据的时候
in the future, and process data in the future

401
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,360
开源在其中
how does open source

402
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,480
扮演了怎样的角色 你曾提到
play a role in that? You mentioned that you

403
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,630
你之所以要创建一个开源的解决方案 是因为你个人的理念
wanted to create an open source solution because of your personal philosophy and

404
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,860
和你对自由和开源软件的强烈感情
your strong feelings on free and open software

405
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:21,310
你如何看待开源对未来其他解决方案的影响
How do you see open source affecting other solutions in the future

406
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,150
我认为
I think that, um

407
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,740
特别是在基础设施领域
particularly in the infrastructure space

408
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,780
解决方案正在向开源靠拢
solutions are converging towards open source

409
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:35,200
我认为原因是基础设施领域的成本压力很大
I think the reason for that is there are high cost pressures in the infrastructure space

410
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,580
特别是对于构建
and particularly for people

411
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,650
软件即服务（SaaS）或云服务的人来说
building software-as-a-service or cloud services

412
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,220
低成本的基础设施很重要
it's important that they keep their infrastructure very cheap

413
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,160
从他们的角度来看 开源显然是一个非常好的方法
and open source is obviously a very good way to do that from their perspective

414
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,370
第二个原因更多地
And, I think the second reason is

415
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,780
是社会因素
more of a, I think, a social reason

416
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,850
在这个快速发展的领域里有如此多
and that it's such a fast-moving field where you have

417
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,800
新的工具 新的框架 新的协议 新的数据思维方式
new tools, new frameworks, new protocols new ways of thinking about data

418
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,380
这个领域中有这么多创新和变化
and there's so much innovation and change happening in that space

419
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,650
有这么多不同的产品
and so many different products and

420
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,530
和项目在相互作用
projects that are interacting, that it's very

421
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,960
所以很难以传统方式
hard to do that in a way that is

422
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,240
做到这一点 比如说
sort of based on the traditional model, where you have

423
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,860
让不同的公司互相签订合作协议 共同开发
different companies having partnership agreements and co-development or whatever

424
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,860
开源可以消除此事上的所有阻力
Open source removes all of that friction

425
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,410
Sage Weil 是红帽公司的高级咨询工程师
Sage Weil is a senior consulting engineer at Red Hat

426
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,410
也是 Ceph 项目的负责人
and the Ceph project lead

427
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,900
我要绕回到《经济学人》的 Kenneth Cukier
I'm gonna circle back to Kenneth Cukier from The Economist

428
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,180
以从一个更整体的视角上进行讨论
so we can zoom out a bit

429
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,170
因为我希望 我们能够记住他
because I want us to remember that vision he had

430
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,170
关于人与数据之间关系的看法
about our relationship with data

431
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,380
以及我们从泥板 到印刷机
and how we've progressed from clay tablets to the printing press

432
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,290
再到像 Sage 打造的云端奇迹的进步历程
to cloud-based wonders like the one Sage built

433
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,760
这关乎人类的进步
This is about human progress

434
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,130
关乎我们如何更好地理解世界
and it is about how we can understand the world

435
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,920
如何从现实中总结经验以及如何改善世界
and the empirical evidence of the world better to improve the world

436
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:07,410
这进步也是人类一直以来的使命
It is the same mission of progress that humans have always been on

437
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,420
使命永无止境
The mission never ends

438
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,290
但是 与此同时 学会处理我们收集到的数据
But, in the meantime, learning to process the data we've gathered

439
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,250
并将其投入使用 是整整一代人的开源任务
and put that flood to work

440
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,380
并将其投入使用 是整整一代人的开源任务
that's an open source mission for a whole generation

441
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,120
我们将在田纳西州的橡树岭国家实验室
We're ending our data journey with a quick stop

442
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,300
短暂停留 结束我们的数据之旅
at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee

443
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,657
它是世界上最快的超级计算机 Summit 的所在地 
It's home to Summit, the world's fastest supercomputer 

444
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:43,140
 至少在 2018 年是最快的超级计算机
 or at least fastest as of 2018

445
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:48,610
这台机器每秒能处理
This machine processes 200,000 trillion calculations

446
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,870
 20 万亿次计算
per second

447
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,520
换个计量单位 就是 200 petaflops
That's 200 petaflops, if you're counting

448
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,890
这样的处理速度
Processing speed like that

449
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,780
对于医院、银行或者今天
isn't practical for hospitals or banks

450
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,540
所有受益于高性能计算的
or all the thousands of organizations

451
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,580
成千上万的组织来说并不现实
that benefit from high high performance computing today

452
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,890
像 Summit 这样的超级计算机
Supercomputers like Summit

453
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,810
更多的是留给强子对撞机的领域
are reserved more for Hadron Collider territory

454
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,410
不过话说回来
But then again

455
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:15,930
我们曾经在泥板上记录的只是 100 字节的信息
we were once recording just a hundred bytes of info on clay tablets

456
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,520
在数据存储和数据处理的领域中
The story of data storage and data processing

457
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,040
非凡的壮举不断成为新的常态
is one where extraordinary feats

458
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,320
非凡的壮举不断成为新的常态
keep becoming the new normal

459
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:29,790
有一天 我们或许能将 Summit 级别的超级计算机装进口袋
One day, we might all have Summit-sized supercomputers in our pockets.

460
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:33,480
想一想 到时候我们能够搜索到的答案
Think of the answers we'll be able to search for then

461
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,120
下一集 我们聊聊无服务器
Next episode, we're going serverless

462
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,800
或者 真的没服务器吗
Or are we

463
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,900
第 7 集将会讲述我们与基于云的开发之间
Episode 7 is all about our evolving relationship

464
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,900
不断发展的关系
with cloud-based development

465
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,240
我们将会探究 在我们的工作中有
We're figuring out how much of our work we can abstract

466
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,040
多少可以抽象化的部分 以及在这个过程可能会失去的东西
and what we might be giving up in the process

467
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,010
同时 如果你想深入了 ChRIS 的故事
