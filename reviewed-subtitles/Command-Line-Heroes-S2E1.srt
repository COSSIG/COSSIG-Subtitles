00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
*BGM~*

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,000
一群朋友正在玩 《D&D》
注：龙与地下城 Dungeons and Dragons 
A group of friends is partway through a game of D&D.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
他们靠在一起 听他们的地下城城主（DM）发话 
They lean in together and listen to their dungeon master.

4
00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:13,000
好的 你拿起法杖念着咒语 
Okay, so you're casting the, so yeah, you grab your staff

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,120
把自然的力量注入其中 
and you channel the forces of nature into it.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,330
你可以看到藤蔓从里面伸出来 和你结合在一起
 And you can see vines coming out of it and it just bonds to you.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,500
它在你手中的重量明显不同了 你感觉到了更强大的力量 
And you, it feels differently weighted in your hands now and you feel much more powerful.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,700
你本回合已经施了这个魔法…
So that's what you do, you cast a spell this round...

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,210
 好的你做到了 你还有一次行动机会 
Alright, so you do that and you still have an action.

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,000
你要做什么呢？ 
What do you do?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,630
*BGM*

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,200
好吧 我得承认： 
Okay, a confession:

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,300
我小的时候 从来没有坐在地下室里玩过《D&D》游戏 
when I was growing up I never sat in a basement playing D&D.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,000
我也从没有渴望过成为一名 DM 不管它是什么 
I did not long to be a dungeon master, whatever that is.

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,630
我不会在真人角色扮演游戏中的树林里找我的第一个男朋友 
I did not find my first boyfriend while LARPing in the woods

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,658
*真可悲~*
Pathetic~
也不会在漫展的过道上和我的死党黏在一起 
 or bond with my BFF while cruising the aisles at Comic-Con.

17
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:50,900
也不会在漫展的过道上和我的死党黏在一起 
 or bond with my BFF while cruising the aisles at Comic-Con.

18
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,300
那不是我 
It just wasn't me. 
*苍白地反驳*

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,900
但我知道的是 游戏把人们聚集到了一起并形成了社区 
But what I do get is that games brought people together into communities.

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:04,500
而且 对于众多的开发者而言 游戏是编程的入门良方
 And, for a huge number of developers out there, games were the gateway drug into programming.

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,500
正是游戏让他们了解计算机 
  It was games that taught them about computers

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,800
并第一次将他们带入一个以极客为骄傲的空间 
and got them in a room where they could geek out with pride for the first time.

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
正是对游戏的热爱让他们想自己开发一款游戏 
It was the love of gameplay that made them want to build a game themselves.

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,500
然后他们超越了游戏的范畴 进入更为广大的软件开发领域
Then go beyond gameplay to just build.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,900
这是我非常喜欢的东西 
And that's something I'm very much into.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,400
在第一季中 我们探讨了开源从何而来 
In our first season, we explored where open source came from,

27
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,100
以及它是如何影响了开发者世界中的每一个环节 
and how it's shaping every part of the developer's world.

28
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,900
这一季我们就在代码里面讲述： 
 This season we're living right on the command line itself:

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,900
如今 成为一名开发人员究竟意味着什么？ 
what it means to be a developer today.

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,900
这一切都是从找到你的伙伴开始的 
And all that starts with finding your people.

31
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,200
那么来吧 游戏开始了！
So let the games begin.

32
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,700
*BGM*

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,700
甚至在“开源”和“互联网”这两个术语被创造之前 
Before the terms open source and internet were even coined,

34
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,100
就已经有了游戏玩家 
there were gamers

35
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,100
那些游戏玩家想要相互连接起来 
And those gamers wanted to connect with each other.

36
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,600
当世界开始联网时 他们走在了前列 
When the world started going online, they were at the front of the pack.

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,200
他们要建立连接和共享所需的一切 并且
And they would build whatever it took to connect and share and—

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,116
哦 它上楼了
Oh, and it goes up.

39
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:11,760
 哦天哪 它发怒了 
 Oh nice. And it goes crazy.

40
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,840
现在这把武器的伤害骰是 8
Yep, the weapon's damage die becomes 8.

41
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,820
随便你 来吧！ 
There you go, you were right.

42
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,970
所以 捅它！耶！
So stab it, yeah.

43
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,000
捅谁 德鲁伊吗？
Which, the druid--

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,760
我干掉它了！ 
I did it!

45
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,970
好吧 接着玩吧 
Yeah, and play.

46
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:26,980
*BGM~*

47
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,120
我是 Saron Yitbarek
 I'm Saron Yitbarek

48
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,700
这里是红帽原创播客《代码英雄》第二季 
and this is season two of Command Line Heroes,

49
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,700
今天的节目是《按下启动键 游戏和开源社区》
Today's episode, Press Start, gaming and open source communities.

50
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,690
你站在一条路的尽头 前面是一座砖砌的小型建筑 
You are standing at the end of a road before a small, brick building.

51
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,600
你周围是一片森林 
 Around you is a forest.

52
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,900
一条小溪从建筑物里流出 顺着沟壑而下  
A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully.

53
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,000
你对这些话有印象吗？ 
Do you recognize those words?

54
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,400
如果你还记得 可以给你的历史知识打 10 分 
 If you do, ten points for knowing your history.

55
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,900
如果你和我一样 对它们没有印象 
But, if you're like me and they did not ring a bell,

56
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,170
那么这些都是 《巨洞探险》的开场白 
those are the opening lines of Colossal Cave Adventure.

57
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,170
什么是《巨洞探险》？ 
What is Colossal Cave Adventure?

58
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,660
我的朋友 一切的改变始于 1976 年 
That, my friend, is the 1976 game that changed everything.

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,260
那条路 森林边的砖房 
That road, that brick building by the forest,

60
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,750
那条流入沟壑的小溪 当时没有人知道 
 that stream flowing down into a gully, nobody knew it at the time,

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,190
但这款基于文本的游戏（是的 根本没有图形） 
but this text-based game—yep, no graphics at all—

62
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:36,630
将是一扇闪亮的红色大门 通向了新的社区和协作形式 
would be a shiny red door that led the way to new forms of community and collaboration.

63
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,950
*放映机播放声*

64
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,800
《巨洞探险》是一种被称为文字冒险的游戏 
Colossal Cave Adventure was a type of game that's known as a text-based adventure.

65
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,000
你可以通过输入命令与计算机交互：
You interact with the computer by typing in commands:

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,400
向西走、拿上剑、爬山等等 
go west, get sword, climb mountain.

67
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
这是 Jon-Paul Dyson 
That's Jon-Paul Dyson.

68
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,850
他是 斯特朗国家游乐博物馆的副馆长 
 He's a VP at the Strong National Museum of Play

69
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,000
也是其电子游戏历史中心的主任 
and the director of their Center for the History of Electronic Games.

70
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,630
是的 相当有趣的工作 
So, yeah, pretty fun job.

71
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,000
《巨洞探险》是一种非常不同类型的游戏 
Colossal Cave Adventure was a very different type of game.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
它更像是一款流程自由的探险游戏 
It was more of a free flowing, exploratory game,

73
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,650
就像在此时问世的《龙与地下城》一样 
like Dungeons and Dragons, which comes out at just this moment in time.

74
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,650
因此 它开启了想象力 
And so it opens the imagination.

75
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,770
这是一款真正革命性的游戏…
So it was a really revolutionary game...

76
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,860
在 70 年代中期出现了一种新型游戏 这绝非偶然 
It's no accident that a new kind of game appeared in the mid-'70s.

77
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,560
正在其时 互联网的前身 - 阿帕网（ARPANET）出现了 
Right at that time, the internet's granddaddy, the ARPANET, was coming to life.

78
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,760
事情是这样的 一位在 ARPANET 上工作的人
What happened is, one of the guys working on ARPANET,

79
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,750
他叫 Will Crowther 
 a guy named Will Crowther,

80
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,130
有了开发这个洞穴探险游戏的想法 
had this idea for developing this cave exploration game.

81
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,340
他大致依据他曾探索过的 肯塔基州猛犸象洞穴的一部分为基础 
 Now he created this game based loosely on a section of Mammoth Cave in Kentucky

82
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,400
创作了这款游戏 
that he had explored.

83
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:56,000
这真是革命性的突破 因为它给了玩家一个探索环境的机会 
And it was really revolutionary in the way that it gave players a chance to explore this environment.

84
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,250
不过更有趣的是 他去度假了 
 But what's interesting was because ARPANET was now around,

85
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,940
而另一个人 叫 Don Woods 的伙计 
and someone else, this guy, Don Woods,

86
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,240
因为当时 ARPANET 的存在而发现了这个游戏
was able to discover the game,

87
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,420
然后做了些调整 
and then make all these adjustments.

88
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,560
因此几乎从一开始 这个游戏的开发就是一个协作过程 
So almost from the very beginning, the game was a collaborative process

89
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,300
因为它已在网络上被共享 
because it had been shared on this network.

90
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,630
这恰是一个很好的例子 
And it was just a good example of

91
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:25,510
说明了游戏是如何被开发、修改、改进 然后广泛传播的 
 how a game could be developed, and modified, improved and then distributed widely

92
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,680
这一切都是因为这些计算机是连接在一起的 
because these computers were connected.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,370
因此 在计算机联网后 
So immediately after computers become networked,

94
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,500
我们可以立即开始使用这些网络来分享游戏 
 we're starting to use those networks to share games.

95
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,500
而这些游戏本身也在不断演变 
And those games are evolving along the way.

96
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,900
事情是这样的：
Here's the thing, though:

97
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,040
不仅仅是网络改善了游戏 
 it wasn't just networks improving games,

98
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,840
游戏也改善了网络 
it was also games improving networks.

99
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,960
因为越多的人想要分享这些游戏 
Because the more people wanted to share those games,

100
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,550
他们就越需要社区的论坛 
the more they needed usable forums for a community.

101
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,640
因此 有了游戏技术 以及热爱它们的社区 它们彼此在相互促进 
So you've got game technology and the communities that love them sort of egging each other on.

102
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,760
这是一个正反馈回路 
 A positive feedback loop.

103
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,720
*诡异~*

104
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,480
同样 游戏开发人员彼此启发 相互借鉴 
Likewise, the game developers are inspired by each other, growing off each other's ideas.

105
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,410
ARPANET 真是一片肥沃的土地 
The ARPANET was hugely fertile ground.

106
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,730
Jon-Paul Dyson 再次发言：
Here's Jon-Paul Dyson again:

107
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:21,526
所以像《冒险》这样的文字冒险游戏就在这种环境里流转 
So text-based adventures like Adventure operated at this space that

108
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,490
这一环境被技术先锋们占据 
that was occupied by pioneering technologists

109
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,353
他们知道如何无厘头、搞笑 知道如何才好玩 
who also knew how to be silly, laugh, and to have fun.

110
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:35,740
早期的游戏确实为开发者社区该如何协同工作提供了一种模式 
Early games really offer a pattern for how communities of developers can work together.

111
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:38,996
请记住 我们这里并不是在讨论 Minecraft 
Remember, we're not talking about Minecraft here,

112
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:41,326
也不是《英雄联盟》 
we're not talking about League of Legends,

113
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:45,143
我们谈论的是黑色屏幕上一行行绿色的文字 
we're talking about lines of green text on a black screen

114
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,916
读完游戏内置的故事 
just reading out a story-based game

115
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:50,383
并让你做出决定 
and inviting you to make your decisions.

116
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,173
这是一种相当简单的游戏文化 
It's a much simpler gaming culture.

117
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,770
但它给了我们巨大的回报 
But it gave us huge rewards.

118
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,643
有一种共同体的信念 认为分享有好处 
There's this communitarian belief in the benefits of sharing,

119
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:09,383
即与生产专有产品相比 更多的协作可以产生更好的结果 
that more collaboration produces better results than producing proprietary products.

120
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:14,030
结果就是你开发的游戏都是从社区中涌现出来的 
And so the result is that you have games developed that emerged out of communities

121
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,956
这些游戏本身对改变持开放态度 
and that are themselves open to being changed

122
00:07:19,123 --> 00:07:21,966
并鼓励人们改变游戏 
and encouraging people to make changes

123
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,863
可能是小的方面 也可能是大的方面 
that might alter the game in minor ways or significant ways.

124
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,780
但有一种感觉是 如果游戏变得更好 那么一切都是好的 
But there's a feeling that if the game is made better, then that's all for the good.

125
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:34,910
所以我认为历史上的这种早期的理念 
And so I think there's this early spirit in the history,

126
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:42,473
尤其是计算机游戏方面 在推动计算机社区的发展方面确实很重要 
especially of computer games, that really is important in pushing forth computer communities

127
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,840
Dennis Jerz 教授特别研究了游戏的历史 
Professor Dennis Jerz has studied the history of games

128
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,480
尤其是《巨洞探险》 
and Colossal Cave Adventure in particular.

129
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:52,716
对他来说 
For him,

130
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:55,280
这些原始开源社区对于所有创造力来说 
these proto-open-source communities

131
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,373
都是一次自由的释放 
were a free for all of creativity.

132
00:07:58,793 --> 00:08:02,406
当时的文化是 
The culture at the time

133
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:10,596
人们在自己工作的基础上建立和分享自己的想法  
involved people building upon and sharing their own ideas.

134
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:16,550
而且很常见的是找到源代码后 
 And it was very common to find the source code,

135
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,550
第一件事就是 
and then the first thing you would do is

136
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,126
在现有的源代码上再增加一个属于自己的空间
add another room to the existing source code.

137
00:08:22,463 --> 00:08:24,743
这和同人创作的想法很像  
It was pretty much like the idea of fan fiction,

138
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:29,363
就是人们创造自己的故事 
the whole idea that you have people who are creating their own stories

139
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:32,716
这些故事穿插在《哈利·波特》的不同章节之间 
that fit in between various chapters of Harry Potter books

140
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,563
或者是《饥饿游戏》中 Katniss 的世界里的小角色的故事 
or here's what happened to the minor characters in Katniss' world from the Hunger Games.

141
00:08:37,803 --> 00:08:44,003
这种在主叙事的基础上进行补充、阐述和构建的文化 
This culture of adding to, and elaborating and building upon a main narrative.

142
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:50,010
好吧 所以我现在急着要找 Van Tyler 
Okay, so I am rushing over now to Van Tyler

143
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,463
看看她的伤口 
and looking at her wounds.

144
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:55,780
哦 上面说武器的伤害变成了 d8 
Oh, the weapon's damage becomes a d8, it says.
注：d8 指“骰一次 8 面骰子所得数值”

145
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,726
在基于图像或视频的游戏出现之前 
Before image or video-based gaming,

146
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:05,046
这些基于想象力的游戏风格为大规模的在线社区铺平了道路 
these imagination-based game styles paved the way for massive online communities down the road.

147
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,830
游戏社区和在线社区之间的是共生的 拥有强韧的联系 
The relationship between gaming and online communities was symbiotic and powerful.

148
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:14,196
但如果说有一件事是游戏玩家都知道 
But if there's one thing the gaming crowd knows,

149
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,556
那就是强大的玩家可以将任务推动到一个新的方向 
it's that powerful players can swerve the mission in a new direction.

150
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,563
随着网络游戏的发展 它以社区为基础的根基开始被侵蚀 
As online gaming grew up, its community-based roots have started to erode.

151
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:28,983
这次试着把它放在他的脖子后面 
And this time try to bring it down on the back of his neck.

152
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:29,586
搞定！
Yeah!

153
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,976
好的 让我们快进到如今 
Okay, let's fast forward to today.

154
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:37,943
互联网已经成熟  
The internet's all grown up.

155
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:43,456
有了它 在线游戏社区已经有了很大进步
And with it, the online gaming community has leveled-up. A lot.
注：level-up 在游戏中一般指升级

156
00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:48,586
如今 游戏每年的收入超过 1000 亿美元 
 Gaming today generates more than 100 billion in revenue each year. 

157
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,730
预计在未来的十年 这个数字还将再翻一倍 
And that's expected to more than double in the next decade.

158
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,486
*硬币声*

159
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,296
但这样的成功也改变了游戏规则 
But all that success has also changed the game.

160
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,590
这不是一群独立开发者 
It's not a group of indie developers

161
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,616
在一个摇摇欲坠的论坛上分享他们的作品 
sharing their work on a rickety forum.

162
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,079
如今的游戏社区与《巨洞探险》时期的情况完全不同 
Game communities that exist today are radically different

163
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,156
如今的游戏社区与《巨洞探险》时期的情况完全不同 
from what was going on in the early days of Colossal Cave Adventure.

164
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:12,340
大家好 我叫 Saku 
Hi, my name is Saku,

165
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,290
我是一家名为 Asteroid 的初创公司的创始人 
I'm the founder of a startup called Asteroid,

166
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,513
我公司为游戏开发者制作增强现实（AR）工具 
which makes augmented reality tools for game developers.

167
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:25,236
Saku Panditharatne 觉得开放的互联网与游戏开发之间的关系 
Saku Panditharatne wonders if that relationship between the open internet and game development

168
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:28,240
最近已经扭曲 
has gotten a bit twisted lately.

169
00:10:28,516 --> 00:10:32,986
她说的很清楚 为什么游戏公司之间不共享部分代码 
 She's got a point, why aren't parts of code shared between game companies

170
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,933
而有时候大型科技公司之间却能共享代码呢？
the same way code is sometimes shared between big tech companies?

171
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,016
如果你是唯一一个与所有人共享你的代码的游戏公司 
If you’re the only game company that shares your code with everyone,

172
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,440
那么你的竞争对手只会复制你的代码 
your competitors will just copy you,

173
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,866
他们会拿走你的所有秘密 
and they'll take all your secrets

174
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,786
并且他们会制作出比你更好的 3A 游戏 
and they'll make a better triple-A game than you.

175
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,370
这对大型科技公司来说也是个问题 
And that was also a problem for big tech companies as well.

176
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:56,963
但实际上 我认为是软件工程师的努力打破了这种平衡 
But it was the efforts of software engineers that actually, I think, broke this equilibrium

177
00:10:57,193 --> 00:11:01,390
因为如果没有人为一家闭源的公司工作 
 Because if no one worked for a company that kept its code source,

178
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,013
那么每个人都会被迫开源 
then everyone was forced to go open source

179
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:07,726
然后所有的大科技公司都会尽可能地共享 
and then you get all the big tech companies sharing as much as they can,

180
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,900
这对软件整体来说是非常好的 
which is very good for software as a whole.

181
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:12,896
但这在游戏行业中从未发生过 
But that never happened with games.

182
00:11:13,676 --> 00:11:16,556
Saku 的理论是 与其他领域相比 
Saku's theory that traditionally in gaming

183
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:21,960
在游戏领域的传统上 开发者没有同样的决策控制权 
the developers haven't had the same control over decision making compared to other fields.

184
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,673
那太糟糕了 因为这意味着我们都错过了开放 
And that's too bad, because it means we're all missing out.

185
00:11:25,906 --> 00:11:27,973
我们基本上知道具体如何 
We basically know exactly how to

186
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:32,220
将渲染、着色以及物理模拟做到很高的标准 
 do rendering and shading and physics to a really high standard.

187
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,363
那不应该是每个游戏工作室都在重新发明的东西 
And that shouldn't be something that every single game studio is replicating.

188
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:42,890
但是奇怪的是 游戏工作室通常仍会在内部构建引擎 
But, weirdly enough, it is often the case that games studios still will build engines in-house.

189
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,003
不幸的是 他们陷入了这种…
Unfortunately, they're stuck in this kind of ...

190
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,996
我觉得游戏有点像电影 而不是像软件 
I kind of feel like games are a bit more like film than they are like software.

191
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,013
游戏可能会陷入开发地狱
You get games stuck in development hell.

192
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:58,826
你会遇到各种问题 比如制作人的融资问题等等 
You get all these problems with producers financing them and stuff like that.

193
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:03,393
我认为所有这些因素都不利于软件变得更好 
And I think all these factors work against adopting the best possible software.

194
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:04,910
*BGM*

195
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,396
因此 游戏开发中的专有制度 
So, that proprietary approach in game development

196
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,870
导致了大量重复的工作 
leads to a lot of redundant work.

197
00:12:11,186 --> 00:12:15,020
每个工作室都必须解决同样的问题 
Every studio is forced to solve the same problems.

198
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:18,103
而且它们中的大多数都不是最佳解决方案 
 And most of them aren't optimal solutions, either.

199
00:12:18,783 --> 00:12:22,873
同时 对于可能会提供新东西的独立开发人员来说
Meantime, things quickly become unaffordable for indie developers

200
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:24,603
事情很快变得难以承受 
that might have something new to offer.

201
00:12:25,256 --> 00:12:29,623
游戏开发人员通常必须购买某个主流游戏引擎的许可证 
Game developers often have to buy licenses for one of the major game engines.

202
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,886
或者 他们必须得购买灯光脚本之类的工具
Or, they'll have to buy, say, a lighting script.

203
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:37,773
另一方面 Web 开发人员拥有更多可接受的选择 
Web developers, on the other hand, have way more affordable options.

204
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:39,946
我觉得真正有趣的一个事实是 
One fact I find really interesting is that

205
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,720
拍一部电影比做一架飞机更复杂 
it's more complex to make a movie than it is to make an airplane.

206
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,670
这是因为你需要召集这样一群人 他们的技能各不相同
That's just because you have all these different people with very different skill sets,

207
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,240
他们的工作时间表不同 
they work on a different schedule,

208
00:12:49,473 --> 00:12:51,376
他们受到的激励也不同 
they're incentivized by different things.

209
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:56,280
所以 让他们一起工作就像一场组织挑战 
So, then, getting them to work together is like an organizational challenge.

210
00:12:56,423 --> 00:13:00,200
而游戏引擎和其他游戏开发工具的作用之一就是
And one of the things that game engines and other game software does—

211
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,850
弥合这样的鸿沟
it's about bridging that divide

212
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,306
这让它们几乎成为最高效的工作软件
almost as much as it is about being the most efficient software for the job.

213
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,560
游戏开发的问题很像电影制作问题 
Game development's problem is a lot like that movie production problem.

214
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,253
你有艺术家、编剧、角色设计师 
You've got artists, storytellers, character designers,

215
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:17,026
都在与程序员和系统管理员角力 
all wrestling with programmers and sysadmins.

216
00:13:17,426 --> 00:13:22,560
如果不采取开源的态度 或者没有建立共享和同步的方式 
 Without adopting open source attitudes, without building in ways to share and sync up,

217
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,786
那一群不同角色的人就会变得混乱 
that crowd of different people with different roles can get chaotic.

218
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:31,413
这一切都归结为建设社区的挑战 
It all boils down to the challenge of building community.

219
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:35,833
那些最初的游戏 是由开发者利用自己的空闲 
Those first games, they were being built by the developers themselves,

220
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,833
例如午休时间开发的 
like, during their lunch breaks.

221
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:40,830
另一方面 像《魔兽世界》这样的游戏 
Games like World of Warcraft, on the other hand, 

222
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:44,580
他们有大量的创意人员和程序员 
they've got this mammoth mix of creatives and programmers.

223
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,336
社区已经达到了极限 
The communities get stretched to their limit.

224
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,340
例如 我认为没有哪个论坛
I don't think there's any forum

225
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,883
可以让开发人员向角色设计师提出“PR”以供审查 
where developers make pull requests for character designers to review.
注：这里的 PR 即 pull request，是 git 中向储存库提交更改的方式之一

226
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:55,225
但也许应该有 “PR”
But maybe there should be.

227
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,070
 Saku 知道我在说什么 
 Saku knows what I'm talking about.

228
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,810
我认为游戏的一个大问题是
I think one big issue for games is that

229
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,876
它是一个跨学科的东西
it's a cross-disciplinary thing.

230
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,893
跨学科做任何事情都是困难的
And doing anything cross disciplinary is difficult

231
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:09,020
因为这几乎就像 C.P.Snow Essay 的文章 《两种文化》 
‘cause it was almost like the C.P.Snow essay "The Two Cultures",

232
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:13,493
你必须把用右脑的、富有创造性思维的人 
 you have to bring together people who are right-brained and creative-minded 

233
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:17,276
用左脑的 擅长逻辑思维的人聚集在一起 
and people who are left-brained and logical and get them to work together on something.

234
00:14:17,936 --> 00:14:20,830
我们能不能花点时间 拜托在座的各位做一件事？
Can we just take a second to ask the world to build something?

235
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:25,513
如果 GitHub 上有人想找出一种开源游戏开发的方法 
If anybody on GitHub wants to figure out a way to do open source game development

236
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:29,349
在开发者和艺术家之间进行转译 
that translates for developers and artists at the same time,

237
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:31,533
你就为世界做出了贡献 
you'd be doing the world a solid.

238
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,776
我有点觉得 游戏的限制
I kinda think that the limit to games

239
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:39,060
一直都是把两群不怎么互相对话的人聚集在一起
has always been bringing together two groups of people who don't really talk to each other

240
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,663
然后努力创造一些东西 
and then trying to build something.

241
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,253
对我来说 这句话简直是在说开源的故事本身
To me, that's the story of open source in a nutshell.

242
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:51,260
特别值得一提的是 Saku 在想办法弥合两个社区之间的差距 
In particular, though, Saku's imagining something to bridge the gap between two communities

243
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:52,933
从而形成一个更大的社区 
to make a larger community.

244
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:57,266
是的 我认为这实际上可以真正改善整个行业 
Yeah, I think it could actually really improve the industry as a whole.

245
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,066
我认为那些大型的新兴创业公司很多都出现在 2007 年左右 
 I think those big boom startups around 2007,

246
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:05,110
都是因为他们可以使用大量的开源软件 
and a lot of that was because there a ton of open-source stuff you could use.

247
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,585
就像是 Ruby on Rails 之类的软件
Ruby on Rails you could use.

248
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,586
而且我认为 如果没有开发者把他们的东西免费放到网上
And I don't think that startup boom could've happened

249
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,243
那股创业热潮就不会发生 
without developers being able to put their stuff online for free.

250
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,586
如果类似的事情发生在游戏行业中 
If something like that happened in games,

251
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,200
我想我们会有比现在更多的独立游戏开发者 
I think we'd have way more indie game developers than there are currently.

252
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:23,230
但有个好消息 
But there's good news.

253
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,870
游戏领域的开源革命 可能已经开始了 
That open source revolution in gaming, it might already be happening.

254
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:30,330
Jon-Paul Dyson 又言道： 
Here's Jon-Paul Dyson again:

255
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:33,980
在电子游戏的历史上 确实存在两个流派： 
So in the history of video games, there's really been two streams:

256
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,586
一个是人们创造专有产品的地方 即封闭系统 
 one is where people create proprietary products, their closed-end systems.

257
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,730
它们通常经过精心打磨 出于商业目的而发布 
They're often highly polished, they release for commercial purposes.

258
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,773
想想像任天堂这样的公司 
Think of a company like Nintendo.

259
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:50,516
任天堂创造了令人赞叹的游戏 但你无法真正进行修改 
Nintendo creates amazing games and you can't really modify.

260
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:58,870
但在电子游戏和电脑游戏的历史上也出现了一种相反的趋势 
But there's also been a countervailing trend in the history of video games, computer games, 

261
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:02,190
这是一种更具协作性的方法 
and that's been a more collaborative approach. 

262
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:06,540
像《我的世界》这样的游戏 
 And something like Minecraft is an example of this,

263
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,386
就是一个现代的例子 人们正在参与对游戏的修改 
 a modern example, where people are making modifications to the game,

264
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,790
那里有一个围绕游戏而生的社区 
there's a community that revolves around the game.

265
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:19,016
你可以从互联网上的某个地方下载 MOD 
You download from the internet, somewhere, and this set of mods

266
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,736
然后在游戏中引入 
that you're introducing into the game.

267
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,210
你拥有的是一种非常不同的 
And so what you have is a very different,

268
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:28,780
几乎是有机的开发游戏的方式 
almost more organic way of developing games,

269
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:34,913
而不是一种更结构化的 可能是商业化的、工程化的方式 
as opposed to a more structured, maybe commercial, engineered approach.

270
00:16:34,913 --> 00:16:39,393
在很多方面 《我的世界》都是诸如 
Minecraft is in many ways the heir to earlier games like

271
00:16:39,393 --> 00:16:42,673
《太空大战》或《巨洞探险》等早期游戏的继承者 
Space War or Colossal Cave Adventure
注：《太空大战》（Space Wars）由一名大学生开发，意在复刻 PDP-1 上的游戏 spacewars! 
该游戏于 1977 年，由 Cinematronics 在街机平台上发行。

272
00:16:42,673 --> 00:16:42,746
注：《太空大战》（Space Wars）由一名大学生开发，意在复刻 PDP-1 上的游戏 spacewars! 
该游戏于 1977 年，由 Cinematronics 在街机平台上发行。

273
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:43,948
该游戏在社区中发展 对进行修改和改变的人们更开放 
that develops in a community and is much more open to people making modifications and changes.
注：《太空大战》（Space Wars）由一名大学生开发，意在复刻 PDP-1 上的游戏 spacewars! 
该游戏于 1977 年，由 Cinematronics 在街机平台上发行。

274
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:50,003
该游戏在社区中发展 对进行修改和改变的人们更开放 
that develops in a community and is much more open to people making modifications and changes.

275
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,070
而且 其指导思想是 从某种意义上说 
And the governing philosophy is that

276
00:16:53,463 --> 00:17:00,046
以长远角度来看 大众努力的成果
somehow the work of the crowd is going to be better in the long term,

277
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:03,076
将会比一个小团队或个人的作品更好
than the work of one small selected team or individual.

278
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,920
我认为我们现在要说的是 
I think what we're getting at here is that

279
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,376
游戏行业并没有完成社区的建设 
gaming isn't finished building communities,

280
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,106
你也永远不能消灭这种开源精神 
you're never going to stamp out that open source spirit.

281
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:15,710
这就是我们所知道的： 
Here's what we know:

282
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:19,710
游戏仍然激发了许多开发人员 
gaming still inspires legions of developers.

283
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:24,180
这就是许多代码英雄最初进入该行业的原因 
It's what got a lot of Command Line Heroes into this industry in the first place.

284
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:28,140
比如像 Josh Berkis 这样的代码英雄 
Command Line Heroes like Josh Berkis.

285
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,390
嗯 我是从 Atari 800 开始的 
Well, I started out on the Atari 800,

286
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:33,666
因为你可以用它设计自己的游戏
because you could design your own video games.

287
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,540
以及 Ann Barcomb 
And Ann Barcomb.

288
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,103
我写的大多是冒险游戏
I wrote choose your own adventure games mostly.

289
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:41,863
那里面全是屎山代码
And it was horrible spaghetti code.

290
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,453
还有 Justin Flory
And Justin Flory.

291
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:47,443
在我意识到我在做开源之前 我就已经开源了
I started doing open source before I realized I was doing open source.

292
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:52,856
我从一台运行着《我的世界》的游戏服务器开始的 那时我 15 岁 
I began with a game server... I was running a Minecraft server and at the time I was 15.

293
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,120
当人们热爱某事时
When there's this much love for something,

294
00:17:56,276 --> 00:18:00,810
那么对社区、对开源的态度就会蓬勃发展
this much community, open source attitudes are going to thrive.

295
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,546
Saku 对于游戏开发中专有要素的警告
Saku's warnings about proprietary gaming elements

296
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,763
实际上正是游戏在其旅程中必须克服的障碍 
are really just the hurdle that gaming has to overcome on its journey.

297
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:12,513
一些游戏行业的领先者正开始实现这一飞跃 
A few leaders in gaming are starting to make that leap.

298
00:18:12,513 --> 00:18:17,010
*BGM*

299
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,270
我们实际上做得很好 
We actually did good.

300
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,520
我当时正在疯狂射击 我干掉了 3 个 
I was on freaking fire, I had 3 kills

301
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,750
他们干掉了 1 个 
and they had one.

302
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,013
哦 Campbell 带我起飞
Yeah, Campbell was carrying me.

303
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:27,946
如果你去年就快到 12 岁了 
If you've been anywhere near a 12-year-old this past year,

304
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,250
你很可能听说过一个叫《堡垒之夜》的小游戏 
you've likely heard of a little game called Fortnite.

305
00:18:32,573 --> 00:18:33,910
嗯 很小的游戏 
Well, little.

306
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:39,273
在它发布的第一年 它就获得了超过 1.25 亿的玩家 
 In its first year, it gained more than 125 million players

307
00:18:39,566 --> 00:18:43,190
所有玩家都在一场大逃杀 
all interacting in a massive battle royale.

308
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,506
我得下线了 好吧就一会 我得给我父母打个电话 
I've got to, alright, one sec, I've just got to call my parents.

309
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:50,560
是的 游戏在建立社区方面还是很不错的 
So, yeah, games are still pretty good at building community.

310
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,866
实际上 《堡垒之夜》 是有史以来最大的免费主机游戏 
In fact, Fortnite is the biggest free-to-play console game of all time.

311
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,200
它背后的工作室 Epic  
The studio behind it, Epic,

312
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,180
 还创建了《堡垒之夜》所使用的虚幻游戏引擎 
also created the Unreal game engine, which Fortnite uses.

313
00:19:02,563 --> 00:19:04,560
很多其他的游戏也都使用虚幻引擎  
Lots of other games use Unreal, tool,

314
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:08,436
因为 Epic 向世界免费发布了虚幻引擎 
because Epic released the Unreal engine to the world for free.

315
00:19:09,003 --> 00:19:13,003
它不是直接开源的 但它的源代码是可访问的 
It's not straight-up open source, but it is source-accessible.

316
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:16,280
这远超了大多数的游戏工作室 
And that's well beyond what most studios do.

317
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,926
有了虚幻引擎 任何人都可以获取到源代码
With Unreal engine, anybody can grab the source code.

318
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:22,203
他们不仅提供了代码 
They didn't just make the code available though,

319
00:19:22,403 --> 00:19:26,636
还致力于建立一个答案中心、论坛、开发者支持 
they committed to building an answer hub, forums, developer support.

320
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:32,596
Epic 正在加倍努力建设社区 使其尽可能地广大
Epic is doubling down on building as big and broad a community as possible.

321
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:33,846
而且他们并不孤单 
And they're not alone.

322
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:38,390
你已经有了像 Godot 和 MonoGame 这样的完整的开源游戏引擎 
You've got full-on open source game engines like Godot and MonoGame,

323
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:41,390
它们正在催生自己的开发社区 
 which are spawning their own development communities.

324
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:45,196
红帽公司的软件工程师 Jared Sprague 是新一代的一员 
 Jared Sprague, a software engineer over at Red Hat,

325
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:51,783
他们可以使用所有这些工具和引擎来构建令人惊叹的游戏 
is part of a new generation that gets to use all these tools and engines to build amazing games

326
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:54,780
如果没有这些社区 他们是永远不可能创造出这种东西的 
they could never have built without those communities.

327
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,880
独立游戏行业最近发展很快
The indie game industry has grown a lot recently.

328
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,626
因此 你应该发现几年前
So you've seen a while ago, like several years ago,

329
00:20:03,993 --> 00:20:06,366
大多数游戏都是由大型工作室制作的
 most of the games were made by big studios.

330
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:09,370
这些都还在市场上 对吧 任天堂之类的 
Those are still all out there, right, Nintendo and stuff.

331
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:12,370
独立游戏产业正在爆炸式增长
The indie industry has exploded.

332
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:16,553
我认为这很大程度上是因为 Steam 
And I think a lot of that is due to Steam, actually.

333
00:20:17,476 --> 00:20:19,326
他说的就是 Steam 平台 
That'd be the Steam platform

334
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:21,916
它让开发者可以将
that lets developers incorporate things like

335
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,973
游戏内聊天功能、社交网络服务等所有好的东西整合在一起 
in-game chat functionality, social-networking services, all that good stuff

336
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,640
他们在这方面已经做了 15 年了 
They've been at this for about 15 years.

337
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:33,246
Steam 使任何游戏开发者 
Steam made it possible for any game developer

338
00:20:33,246 --> 00:20:36,250
都有可能发布一款游戏给数百万人
to get a game out in front of millions of people. 

339
00:20:36,956 --> 00:20:42,646
有很多著名游戏最开始是独立游戏
There've been lots of big games that started as an indie,

340
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,960
也许只有一两个人在做 最后大放异彩 
maybe just one or two people working on it that just exploded.

341
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,510
《我的世界》就是一个很好的例子 
Minecraft is a perfect example.

342
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,626
刚开始 只有一个人 是独立开发者 
Started, just a guy, indie developer.

343
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:58,166
现在这是有史以来影响力最大的游戏之一
And now it's one of the biggest games ever in history.

344
00:20:58,276 --> 00:20:59,730
但这只是一个例子 
 But it's just an example of

345
00:20:59,986 --> 00:21:04,826
说明独立游戏是如何真正成为游戏行业的主要力量 
how indie has really become a major force in the game industry.

346
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,283
Jared 与他的红帽伙伴 Michael Clayton 
Jared's teamed up with his Red Hat pal, Michael Clayton,

347
00:21:09,283 --> 00:21:11,046
合作举办了 gamejams
 to produce game jams,

348
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,676
一群独立游戏开发人员聚集在一起 
where a bunch of indie game developers get together

349
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,830
在短时间中制作游戏 就像黑客松一样 但用于游戏 
and build games in a short amount of time. Like a hackathon, but for games.

350
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:20,440
GitHub 上有一个叫做 Game Off 的版本 
GitHub has one called Game Off.

351
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,050
Jared 的版本叫做 Open Jam 
Jared's version is called Open Jam.

352
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:27,553
他会说这是基于社区的游戏开发未来的一部分 
If you ask him, it's part of a community-based game development future

353
00:21:27,796 --> 00:21:30,256
其前景极为广大
that could get much, much bigger.

354
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,596
例如 你可以使用 Linux 
You could use, like Linux,

355
00:21:33,656 --> 00:21:37,470
因为它是开源的 所有人都可以为它做贡献 
Because it was open source and all these people could contribute to it

356
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,870
添加工具、补丁等等 
 and add tools and patches and stuff

357
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,343
这就是它如此伟大的原因 
is what it made it so great.

358
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:46,223
比一个人独自完成的要好得多
Way better than just one person could do on their own.

359
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:55,250
而且我认为开源的游戏 或游戏系统 或者说虚拟世界仍有潜力 
And I think there's still potential for a game or some sort of game system or virtual world that was open source,

360
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:01,426
成千上万的人能在其中贡献 做得比一个人多得多
that thousands of people could contribute to build something bigger than one person could do.

361
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:09,016
游戏工作室对开源的态度已然开始转变
It's already starting to happen, a shift towards open source attitudes in the gaming studios.

362
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:16,070
我认为 一旦社区能在游戏的基础上发挥创造力
I think the power of being able to enable your community to create

363
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,056
它的这种力量是毋庸置疑的 
is unquestioned.

364
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,243
Jordan Weisman 是 Harebrained Schemes 的联合创始人 
Jordan Weisman's the co-founder of Harebrained Schemes.

365
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:25,733
《血色苍穹》、 《暴战机甲兵》、《机甲战士》这些都是他的作品 
Crimson Skies, Battle Tech, Mech Warrior, those are all his.
注：三者皆为上世纪末的游戏 IP，在欧美较为著名。其中，后两者在近年仍有新作。
其中 Crimson Skies 似乎没有官方的中文译名

366
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,730
他长期从事游戏开发  
 He's been deep in game development a long time.

367
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,964
而他现在看到的是 
And what he's seeing now is a shift

368
00:22:30,964 --> 00:22:35,626
随着工作室开始意识到好处 他们对开源的态度也在转变 
toward open source attitudes as studios start to realize the benefits.

369
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,630
甚至像《暴战机甲兵》之类的游戏也有很多…
Even games like Battle Tech, which have a fair amount of ...

370
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:43,750
我们已经尝试向玩家开放尽可能多的游戏数据 
We've tried to open up as much of the data of the game as possible to the audience.

371
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,300
而且我们已经看到玩家为游戏提供了惊人的 MOD 
 And we've seen the audience come up with amazing mods for the game.

372
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,053
我们很高兴能看到
 And it's super exciting for us to see

373
00:22:52,053 --> 00:22:54,776
他们如何发挥创造力 又创造出如何的成果
their creativity goes and what they've accomplished.

374
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,810
它们以和游戏本身内容不同的方式吸引着玩家 
And it engages players in different ways than our original content has.

375
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,266
这只是关于你能做什么的一个小例子 
And that's a small example of what you can do.

376
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,270
随着游戏的发展 
 And as we go forward with our games,

377
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,013
我们更加知晓了这一点 越来越开放 
 we're leaning on that even heavier, opening up more and more

378
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:09,799
让玩家表达他们的创造力 
to allow players to express their creativity.

379
00:23:10,786 --> 00:23:15,966
Jordan 认为 制作 MOD 的文化有助于使他的游戏尽善尽美
Jordan figures that a modifying culture helps his games become the best they can be.

380
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,596
但是你知道 
 But, you know,

381
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,600
就像我们在本期节目的《D＆D》开场白中所暗示的那样 
like we hinted at with our D&D opener to this episode,

382
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:23,880
对社区的推动始终存在 
that drive toward community was always there.

383
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:26,966
TRPG 来自于 GM 与玩家之间 
They come from tabletop roots

384
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,550
互相用语言编织一场冒险的 RPG 游戏 
where it was a collaborative storytelling experience among the people at the table

385
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:34,003
人们围坐在一张桌子前合作讲故事并分享经验 
 between the game master and the players in an RPG.

386
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:39,470
在某段时间内 当我们开始分享某些电子游戏时 
And as we moved into digital forms of those kinds of games, for a period of time,

387
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,933
这两派非常分裂 
 that was very separated.

388
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:46,946
我认为 随着 MOD 工具和大家都能接触的引擎的诞生 
I think, as modding tools and democratization of the engines and tools

389
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,580
工具变得更易获得 和开发商转向开源 
that are accessible and moving to open sourcing,

390
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,613
让我们重新回到了游戏的创建之初 
it kind of moves us back closer to that collaborative nature of creating

391
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:58,610
这种非常社交化的 具有协作性的娱乐方式
this very social form of entertainment.

392
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,096
所以我觉得这很令人兴奋 
So I think that's very exciting.

393
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,523
我也这样认为 
I think so too.

394
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:05,520
至于 Jared Sprague 
As for Jared Sprague,

395
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,240
他将再次与 Michael Clayton 合作 
 he's teaming up with Michael Clayton, again,

396
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,163
开发一款全新的社区驱动的开源游戏 
to build a brand new, community-driven, open source game. 

397
00:24:12,163 --> 00:24:14,899
它被称为…
And it's called...

398
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,616
《代码英雄》 
Command Line Heroes.

399
00:24:17,616 --> 00:24:20,756
*庆贺吧！*

400
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,810
是的 我们正式成为一个多平台 IP 
Yep, we're officially a multi platform IP.

401
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:30,776
当然 《代码英雄》游戏将成为一个开源项目 
And naturally, the Command Line Heroes game is going to be an open source project.

402
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,620
所以我们邀请社区（也就是你） 
So we're inviting the community, that's you, yes you,

403

 好吧 虽然这个游戏的代码一直可以访问的 
Well, while the code for that game was always accessible,

但我们知道游戏将会推动这一进程
