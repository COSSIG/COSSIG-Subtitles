1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:07,000
1965 年是美国历史上发生重大变化的一年
1965 was a year of massive change in America.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
《民权法案》就是在那年签署的
The Civil Rights Act was signed.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,570
Congress passes the most sweeping civil rights bill ever to be written into the law.
“…国会通过了史上影响最为广泛的《民权法案》”

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,450
Congress passes the most sweeping civil rights bill ever to be written into the law.
“并将它写进了法律里…”

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,320
作战部队被第一次被派往越南
Combat troops were sent to Vietnam for the first time.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,373
Ways against North Vietnamese party.
“…对抗北越的方式…”

7
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:19,000
男人们烧掉了他们的征兵证
Men burned their draft cards.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Draft cards on the steps of a Boston courthouse.
“…征兵证被放在波士顿法院的台阶上”

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A group of high school boys set upon them with fists.
“一群高中男生挥拳猛捶它们…”

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,250
在纽约 披头士乐队举行了世界上第一场体育馆内的音乐会
The Beatles delivered the world's first stadium concert in New York.

11
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:37,000
但在距离这些大新闻很远的地方 一场与众不同的革命正在酝酿
But, far from all those headlines, a revolution of a different kind was underway.

12
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:41,000
5 月 1 号 凌晨 4 点
4:00 AM, May 1st.

13
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,242
约翰·凯梅尼教授和一名本科生
Professor John Kemeny and an undergrad student

14
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:48,606
正在达特茅斯的 GE 225 型电脑上忙碌着
were working at a GE 225 computer at Dartmouth University.

15
00:00:48,978 --> 00:00:51,000
他们运行了一个刚写好的程序
They ran a program they'd been working on.

16
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:56,000
电传打字机的三行输出
And then the teletypewriter produced three short lines of output.

17
00:00:56,606 --> 00:01:00,329
永远地改变了计算机编程领域
Those three lines changed computer programming forever.

18
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:10,000
欢迎来到红帽原创播客《代码英雄》的第 3 季第 2 集
Welcome to episode 2 of Command Line Heroes, an original podcast from Red Hat.

19
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:12,000
我是主持人 Saron Yitbarek
I'm your host, Saron Yitbarek.

20
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:19,865
在这一集 我们将继续本季的“编程语言的过去与未来”的旅程
In this episode, we continue our season-long journey into the history and future of programming languages.

21
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:23,657
在第 1 集中 我们深入研究了 Python
In episode 1, we dove into Python

22
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:26,621
并了解了开源社区如何在其领导阶层的大动荡中生存下来
and learned how open-source language communities

23
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:29,698
并了解了开源社区如何在其领导阶层的大动荡中生存下来
survive major upheavals in their leadership.

24
00:01:30,146 --> 00:01:33,282
比起上一期节目 本次节目会更注重于个人
But this time, we're getting more personal.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,150
我们的话题是 大家都有过的一种体验
We're looking at an experience we've all had.

26
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:40,346
也就是 与入门语言的邂逅
The experience of encountering our very first language.

27
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,290
我将带领你们领略我学习的第一门语言 Ruby
We'll take a look at my first language, Ruby.

28
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:49,239
以及新手语言是如何用游戏的形式 来到我们身边的
And we'll learn how some first languages come to us in the form of a game.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,728
不过 我得先举个例子
But we're beginning with an example

30
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:56,215
好让大家都能明白“新手语言”到底是什么意思
that can help us understand what first languages really means.

31
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,175
这门语言诞生于
It's the language that was born

32
00:01:58,175 --> 00:02:02,423
之前提到的 达特茅斯实验室的三行输出
in that Dartmouth laboratory with those three short lines of output.

33
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:05,769
在 1965 年那一天的黎明之前
At that pre-dawn meeting in 1965,

34
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:10,541
约翰·凯梅尼作为创造者之一 见证了 BASIC 的诞生
John Kemeny witnessed the birth of his co-creation, BASIC.

35
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,200
BASIC 的意思是“初学者的泛用符号指令代码”
BASIC.

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,453
BASIC 的意思是“初学者的泛用符号指令代码”

37
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:20,103
BASIC 的意思是“初学者的泛用符号指令代码”
It stands for Beginners' All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.

38
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:24,270
这里面的第一个词 “初学者” 正是其不凡之处所在
In that first word, "beginners'", is where the magic lies.

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,348
在早期
In the early days of programming,

40
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:30,222
就算是少量的编程工作 也需要一名博士来完成
you pretty much needed a PhD in order to do a little coding.

41
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,431
这是一种极高的要求 需要大量的教育
It was an elite pursuit that required major education, not to mention major hardware.

42
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:36,814
更不用说那些高级的硬件了
It was an elite pursuit that required major education, not to mention major hardware.

43
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,556
但是凯梅尼教授和他的团队希望改变现状
But Professor Kemeny and his team wanted to change all that.

44
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,950
他们想知道：如果要创造一种所有人都可以使用的编程语言
What would it look like, they wondered, to produce a programming language that anybody could use?

45
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,508
那会带来怎样的不同？
What would it look like, they wondered, to produce a programming language that anybody could use?

46
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:50,860
当美国各地的青年们剧烈地抗议 要求变革时
While teenage baby boomers were demanding change all across America

47
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,566
达特茅斯团队提出了一种另类的革命
the team at Dartmouth proposed a shake-up of another kind.

48
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:03,206
他们的秘密武器是一个房间那么大的大型电脑 - GE 225
Their secret weapon was a room-sized mainframe computer, that GE-225

49
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,644
它重达 2000 磅 这个重量是健康的证明
weighing in at a healthy 2,000 pounds, it was capable of something brand new.
2000 磅大约是 900 千克

50
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,125
和这份不得了的重量相匹配的是 它具备某些全新的功能
weighing in at a healthy 2,000 pounds, it was capable of something brand new.

51
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,638
那就是分时功能
The GE-225 was capable of time-sharing.
也就是时间片 实现了多用户多进程快速切换的技术

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,162
突然间 编程不再需要复杂的打孔卡系统或庞大的开关墙了
Suddenly, the complicated system of punch cards or enormous walls of switches wasn't necessary anymore.

53
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:27,562
分时意味着程序们都可以同时执行
Time-sharing meant that a whole bunch of programs could be executed almost simultaneously

54
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:30,989
因为系统会根据不同用户的需要来回切换其处理内容
with the machine's attention bouncing between users.

55
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,813
分时意味着 使用者可以用惊人的新方式来访问计算机
Time-sharing meant that access to computing could expand in amazing new ways.

56
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:39,000
这是来自达特茅斯的些许录音
Here's some audio from Dartmouth,

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,099
记录了 BASIC 刚诞生的时候
featuring one of the undergrads studying there when BASIC first appeared.

58
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:46,427
65 级的本科生 John McGeachie 学习的实况
Here's John McGeachie, class of '65.

59
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:54,649
我们把这台相当贵的、原本只能一次让一个人用的计算机
We had taken a fairly expensive computer that could only be used by one person at a time

60
00:03:54,777 --> 00:04:00,300
变成了可以…让超过 30 人使用的东西
and converted it into something where it wasn't just 30 users who could use it

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,420
30 名本科生可以同时在这上面编程
it was 30 undergraduate students using this computer simultaneously

62
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,498
还能快速得到输出
writing programs, getting answers quickly.

63
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:14,386
它是史无前例的简洁直接
It was a combination of immediacy and simplicity that had not previously existed.

64
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:21,106
约翰·凯梅尼联合另一位技术普及的布道师托马斯·卡茨
John Kemeny had teamed up with Thomas Kurtz, another evangelist for computer literacy

65
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:23,282
共同开发了 BASIC 语言
to develop the BASIC language.

66
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,755
他们发现 分时让计算机使用变得更亲民
They saw how time-sharing democratized things,

67
00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:30,607
因此准入门槛降低了许多
and knew that the barrier for entry was suddenly so much lower.

68
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:36,419
而剩下的工作则是编写一门简单直白的编程语言
All that was needed was a language that prioritized simplicity and immediacy,

69
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,406
一门像 BASIC 那样的语言
a language like BASIC.

70
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,614
他们开发了像 HELLO 和 GOODBYE 这样的指令
They developed commands like "hello" and "goodbye" instead of "log on" and "log off".

71
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:44,814
来代替 LOG ON 和 LOG OFF 命令
They developed commands like "hello" and "goodbye" instead of "log on" and "log off".

72
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:50,295
事实上 初版 BASIC 只有 14 个简单的指令
In fact, the first version of BASIC only had 14 simple commands,

73
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:53,815
比如条件判断 IF 和 GOTO 之类的简单选项
just easy options like "if", "then", and "go to".

74
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:55,901
我是 Tom Cormen
I am Tom Cormen. I'm a professor of computer science at Dartmouth College.

75
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:58,875
我是达特茅斯大学的一名计算机科学教授
I am Tom Cormen. I'm a professor of computer science at Dartmouth College.

76
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:02,550
Cormen 教授将与我们谈论所谓“初学者的革命”
Professor Cormen spoke with us about that beginner's revolution

77
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:07,067
以及 BASIC 的出现如何成为时代精神的一部分
and how the creation of BASIC really did feel like part of a new zeitgeist

78
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,268
它带来了一个新世界 在其中
a world where

79
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:10,552
计算机技术对更多人来说不仅不再遥不可及 甚至还是激动人心的
computing was exciting to more people,

80
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:12,571
 - 编程甚至变得有点时髦了
even a little bit hip.

81
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:16,025
据说在 60 年代
At the time in the 1960s,

82
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,526
男学生会在这里（计算机中心）约会
it said that the male students would bring their dates there.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,950
我真是不能想象如果发生在现在会是什么样子
I can't really imagine that happening now,

84
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,000
但在那个时候 计算机中心一度是约会的最佳场所
but at the time the computer center was the cool place to be.

85
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:26,902
这种在校园兴起的编程热潮
This new interest in computing on campus

86
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:30,650
是“初学者语言”诞生所带来的直接结果
was the immediate result of that first beginner's language.

87
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,920
BASIC 为那些计算机爱好者降低了准入门槛
BASIC opened up computing to people who weren't just computer jocks,

88
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,456
就如同我们过去说的那样
as we used to say back then.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,725
不想学习 FORTRAN 这类编程语言的社会科学家
Social scientists who really didn't want to get into the weeds of a language like Fortran

90
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:44,000
可以使用 BASIC
could use BASIC.

91
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:47,382
从事人文艺术的人们
and people doing work in the arts and humanities

92
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:52,310
可以用它做文本处理 甚至用来创作艺术作品
if they were doing text analysis or even trying to create art

93
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,166
这些完全可以用 BASIC 来完成
they could use BASIC for that.

94
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:59,350
没过几年 人们就开始写电脑游戏
So after a few years, people were doing things like writing computer games

95
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,318
也时常在编程中实现图形化的内容
and also incorporating computer graphics routinely into their work.

96
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:08,811
对于所有那些不将自己视为程序员的孩子们
All those kids who didn't necessarily see themselves as programmers

97
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:12,617
编程领域的大门 突然间以一种近乎直观的方式打开了
suddenly got into programming on an almost intuitive level.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,585
它让我想起格蕾丝·赫柏所追求的世界
It reminds me of the kind of world Grace Hopper pushed for.

99
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:19,273
当我们上一季谈到赫柏时
When we talked about Hopper last season,

100
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:23,727
我们谈到了她的语言创新如何将编程带到更多人眼前
we saw how her language innovations brought programming to a wider circle.

101
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,672
BASIC 的此时此刻就像是赫柏梦想的延续
This BASIC moment, it was like a continuation of Hopper's dream.

102
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,303
我非常确信 如果格蕾丝·赫柏能看到更多人开始写代码
I'm sure Grace Hopper would have liked seeing more people coding.

103
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:32,492
她会非常高兴
I'm sure Grace Hopper would have liked seeing more people coding.

104
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:38,000
她可能会喜欢 BASIC 和 COBOL 的不同之处
She probably would have liked that BASIC had a different slant from COBOL

105
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,724
因为这种不同为人们提供了更多的选择
and that it just opened things up to people even more and gave them a choice.

106
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:43,940
他们可以写 COBOL 可以写 FORTRAN
They could write in COBOL, they could write in Fortran,

107
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,271
可以写 BASIC 可以写 ALGOL
they could write in BASIC, they could write in ALGOL

108
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,000
可以选择当时任何流行的语言
any of the popular languages of the time.

109
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:58,354
Tom Cormen 是达特茅斯计算机科学系的一名教授
Tom Cormen is a professor in Dartmouth's Computer Science Department.

110
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:05,310
当初 计算机技术中的几大变化催生了新一代的程序员
So a new generation of computer programmers was ushered in

111
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:05,560
当初 计算机技术中的几大变化催生了新一代的程序员

112
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,875
当初 计算机技术中的几大变化催生了新一代的程序员
thanks to a couple of major changes

113
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:13,874
分时功能使并行工作成为可能 而 BASIC 使入门编程变得简单了
simultaneous work made possible by time sharing, and a new simple language, BASIC.

114
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:18,610
这两个因素结合在一起 创造出了改变游戏规则的星星之火
Those two factors combined to create a game-changing spark.

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
很快 编程就不仅是大型机构的专利
Soon, it wasn't just massive institutions that could get into programming

116
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:24,157
这一代程序员中
it was mavericks, like Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak.

117
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:26,546
既有像比尔·盖茨和史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克这样的特立独行者
it was mavericks, like Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak.

118
00:07:26,642 --> 00:07:31,570
也有在个人电脑上每天默默耕耘的开发者
It was also everyday programmers just exploring on their personal computers.

119
00:07:32,475 --> 00:07:39,325
BASIC 能够在程序出错时立即给使用者以反馈
To be able to interact with a language to get immediate feedback when something was wrong

120
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:44,000
这让它的使用体验变得不同 它让你沉浸其中 使你继续前进
that made all the difference in the world because it sucked you in, it kept you going

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
这种交互是有意义的 就因为它是一种交互
and the interaction was meaningful because it was an interaction.

122
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,000
这位是 Denise Dumas 她带领 RHEL 工程师团队
This is Denise Dumas. She runs the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Engineering Team.

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
我认为 BASIC 使编程变得民主了许多
I mean, BASIC democratized programming in a big way, right?

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,876
因为 BASIC 把它自身交予学生、大众
Because it put it in the hands of students, in the hands of people

125
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,117
当时的其他语言 - 像是 COBOL、FORTRAN 之类
in a way that COBAL, Fortran, the other languages of the day,

126
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:12,218
- 根本做不到这一点
it just wasn't possible.

127
00:08:12,486 --> 00:08:18,000
当 CRT（阴极射线管显示器）流行的时候 BASIC 更为火爆
It became really popular at a time when CRTs became popular.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
因为在你输入了信息之后 输出不再是被打印在一张纸上
And so instead of typing something in and getting it printed on a piece of paper

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,617
而是显示在你面前的屏幕上
it displayed on a screen in front of you.

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
我们现在有时候会嘲笑命令行 对吧？
We laugh at command lines sometimes now, right?

131
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,686
现在一切都图形化了 但当时 有命令行已经很好了
Everything is graphics, but the command line was what there was.

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,782
它比命令行之前的时代有了很大的改进
And it was such an improvement over what had been.

133
00:08:39,614 --> 00:08:43,582
这一重大改进就是 你输入指令能够立即得到回应了
That was huge. Just to type something in and get a response.

134
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:45,748
我认为 BASIC 降低了准入门槛
I think that BASIC lowered the bar.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,325
虽然我是那种控制狂 我喜欢汇编 但我还是会这么说的
And I say this as someone who actually loves assembler

136
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:52,565
虽然我是那种控制狂 我喜欢汇编 但我还是会这么说的
because that's the kind of control freak I am

137
00:08:52,885 --> 00:08:56,085
BASIC 使编程变得更加平易近人
but I think BASIC made it much more approachable.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
BASIC 在 1980 年代带来的这份激情一直延续到了今日
The excitement BASIC created in the 1980s lives on today.

139
00:09:03,153 --> 00:09:05,100
现在 有许多语言
With a whole fleet of languages

140
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,324
能被初学者用作进入编程世界的光明大道
that beginners use as shiny red doors into the world of programming.

141
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:12,588
但如今发生了另一些重要的改变：
And yet something important has changed.

142
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:17,260
编程入门不再只有进入大学学习一途
Because those entrances don't just show up on university campuses anymore.

143
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:21,000
今日 条条大路通罗马
The way into programming is becoming even more open.

144
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:33,975
尽管 BASIC 很神奇 但格蕾丝·赫柏的梦想不会止步于此
As amazing as BASIC was, Grace Hopper's dream wasn't going to stop there.

145
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:37,801
如今 初学者有上百种方法可以开始编程
Today, beginners have a hundred ways to find their start.

146
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:40,750
就我而言
And for me, learning a first language

147
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:45,000
我是在纽约市一家名为 Flatiron 的学校学习的第一门语言
meant attending an institution called the Flatiron School in New York City.

148
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:47,465
我为那个项目准备了几个月
I prepared for months for that program.

149
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,629
我阅读了所有可能的编程资源和教程
I read every single programming resource and tutorial

150
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:54,000
以确保它们也许能让我在训练营中获得最大收益
that I possibly could to make sure I got the most out of my boot camp.

151
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:59,461
我想了解当今人们是如何接触自己的入门语言的
I wanted to learn about how people today discovered that first language.

152
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,109
所以 今天我采访了自己当初的那位老师
So I headed back to interview my old teacher.

153
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,000
我是 Avi Flombaum
I'm Avi Flombaum.

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,426
Avi 是 Flatiron 学校的创始人之一
Avi is one of the founders of the Flatiron School.

155
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:12,439
对我来说 和他一起探究有关入门语言的思想
So it was a treat for me to dig into Avi's thoughts about first languages.

156
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,807
和我们接触入门语言的方式
And how our approaches to first languages

157
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:17,943
与 BASIC 的旧时代相比有什么变化 是一种享受
have changed since the old days of BASIC.

158
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:27,400
当你教别人该如何编程时 先从哪里下手呢？
So when you are teaching someone how to code, where do you begin?

159
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,765
我记得当我学习第一门编程语言时
Because I remember when I first learned my first programming language

160
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:32,698
我觉得这一切可真是太奇怪了
thinking, this is so weird.

161
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,845
我在大学读的是英语专业 在学校里我很喜欢数学
You know, I was an English major. I really liked maths when I was in school.

162
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,246
也喜欢有机化学
I liked organic chemistry.

163
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:40,126
我喜欢很多不同的科目 各种各样的东西
There are a lot of things that I was really into, a lot of different subjects.

164
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:43,326
但是没有什么是和编程相似的
But there was nothing I could connect coding to.

165
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:45,438
因此 我也没办法将编程比作什么
There was nothing that was a good analogy.

166
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:47,308
它自成一套 就像一个自己的小世界
You know, it just felt like its own little world.

167
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:49,219
所以 作为老师 你会从哪里开始呢
So as a teacher, where do you start?

168
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:53,827
我认为生活中你所熟悉的任何事物 曾经都是陌生的
I think that anything that is familiar to you in life was once foreign

169
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:56,674
只有经历过
and experiencing it and, you know,

170
00:10:56,674 --> 00:10:59,106
真正花时间去做
waiting in its waters and actually spending time with it

171
00:10:59,106 --> 00:11:00,778
才会让你对它感到习惯
is what makes you comfortable with it.

172
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:05,322
这是不断重复练习的问题 只关乎你投入的时间的多少
And it's just a question of reps and really just time that you put into it.

173
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,475
我认为编程之所以困难 之所以让人感觉如此陌生
I think what makes programming difficult and what makes it feel so foreign

174
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:15,128
是因为它用极其特殊的语法来表达一些东西
is that it is a tremendously particular syntax for expressing something.

175
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:20,376
没有任何歧义 没有错误的余地 要么成功 要么失败
There's zero ambiguity. There's no margin of error. It either works or it doesn't.

176
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,521
当我们互相交流的时候
And when we communicate to each other,

177
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:25,225
我们一般没有那种要求
we generally don't have that kind of requirement

178
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:27,350
一切都必须完全正确
where everything has to be exactly correct.

179
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,510
一个逗号丢了 一个括号缺了 就全坏了
You know, one comma is off, one parenthesis missing and just it's all broken.

180
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,593
我总是说 计算机是愚蠢的
I always say that computers are stupid

181
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:36,848
为了使计算机理解我们的意思 我们必须做到完美
and we have to just be perfect in order to get them understand what we mean.

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,176
这个我喜欢 机器是笨蛋
I like that. I like this idea of the machine being the stupid one

183
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:43,000
我比它聪明 我同意
and me being the smart one. I approve of this. This is great.

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,575
是啊
Yeah.

185
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:48,606
我的第一门编程语言是 Ruby
For me, that first language, the one I cut my teeth on, was Ruby.

186
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,702
根据经验 我可以告诉你 这是一种非常可爱的入门语言
From experience, I can tell you it's a pretty sweet first language.

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
当你阅读代码时 感觉就像你在阅读英语
When you read the code, it feels like you're reading English.

188
00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:58,000
它有很多不错的库
It's got tons of great libraries.

189
00:11:58,206 --> 00:11:59,742
这里插播一则知识补充
And here's a bit of trivia.

190
00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:02,878
Ruby 的创造者 松本行弘
The creator of Ruby, Yukihiro Matsumoto,

191
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,758
是通过学习 BASIC 进入编程领域的
he got into programming by learning BASIC.

192
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:11,000
如今 许多新手可能会改用 Python 或 JavaScript
These days, a lot of newbies might be tackling Python or JavaScript instead.

193
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,500
而我想知道 Avi 你觉得
And I wanted to know whether Avi thought

194
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,950
有没有最理想的入门语言
any one language was a better front door than all the others.

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,838
我想知道 是否有首选的入门语言？
I'm wondering, are there preferred starter languages?

196
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:26,166
如果某人没有技术背景
If someone's coming into this with no tech background,

197
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,434
没有编程经验 也没有计算机科学学历而进入这个领域
no coding experience, no CS degree,

198
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:32,786
那么他们就是从一开始 甚至说从零开始…
they're starting from absolutely nothing from square one, square zero even.

199
00:12:32,914 --> 00:12:38,418
随着时间的推移 有没有更好的初始语言冒出来呢？
Are there preferred languages that are good starting points that have changed over time?

200
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,417
首先 我要说的是每个人都没有背景
Well, first, I'll say that everyone comes into it with no background.

201
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:45,337
没有谁生下来就是程序员
No one is born a programmer.

202
00:12:45,785 --> 00:12:48,225
因此 无论你是有计算机科学学历
So whether you formally learned it in a CS program

203
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,809
还是在社区中心里学习 抑或读书自学
or in your community center or read books and taught yourself,

204
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:53,345
每个人都是从初学者开始的
everyone started as a beginner.

205
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:58,017
然后 就初学者的首选语言而言
And then in terms of the preferred beginner language,

206
00:12:58,017 --> 00:13:00,984
我认为你最先看到的语言就是最好的
I think it's really whatever speaks to you first.

207
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:06,570
我对初学者的建议始终是 选择一种语言并学习它 不要改变
My advice to beginners is always just pick a language and learn it. Don't change.

208
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,122
我认为 初学者最容易犯的错是
I think the biggest thing that beginners do is

209
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,706
我先学习 Python 遭了挫折
start learning Python and then get frustrated with it

210
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:16,586
就说 Python 很烂 现在我要去用 JavaScript 了
and say Python sucks and now I'm going to go do JavaScript.

211
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:19,338
他们学习 JavaScript 然后对 JavaScript 感到沮丧
And then they learn JavaScript and then they get frustrated with JavaScript

212
00:13:19,338 --> 00:13:20,234
然后又换了起来
and then they jump again.

213
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
如你所知 我个人认为 Ruby 是一种很棒的初学者语言
I personally, as you know, think that Ruby is a great beginner language.

214
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,265
我认为它的语法真的很漂亮
I think that its syntax is just really beautiful.

215
00:13:29,265 --> 00:13:33,425
它的理念 明确地就是要使你（程序员）感到高兴
Its value explicitly is to make you the programmer happy.

216
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:37,476
我不知道是否有其他发明来就是要叫程序员开心的语言
I don't know any other language that was invented to make a programmer happy.

217
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:40,484
我知道人们发明了许多语言来使机器开心
I know a lot of languages are invented to make machines happy.

218
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:43,000
但我认为 Ruby 确实很自然
But I think Ruby is really natural.

219
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:48,356
这一点我们可以达成共识 但是同样 这里没有错误的答案
We can agree on that one. But again, there's no wrong answer here.

220
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,288
毕竟 入门语言就是这样
A first language after all is just that.

221
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:56,000
它只是开始 我们所有人都有一生的时间用来学习
A first. We've all got a whole lifetime of language learning ahead of us.

222
00:13:56,472 --> 00:13:59,300
而且 选择一种语言而不是另一种语言
And besides, choosing one language over another

223
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,625
并不会阻止你成为出色的程序员
isn't going to stop you from becoming the awesome programmer you were destined to be.

224
00:14:04,905 --> 00:14:09,577
我喜欢画画 但我不会为了一支笔而死去活来
You know, I like to draw, but I will not live and die by a particular pen.

225
00:14:09,577 --> 00:14:12,550
我不会因为我使用的笔而大动干戈
You know, like I don't get all worked up over the pen that I use.

226
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,465
我为我所创造的东西而激动
I get worked up over the things I create.

227
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:18,400
那么从你的经验来看 为什么会这样呢？
And so from your experience, where does that come from?

228
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,779
在大家面前辩护 让大家相信
Where does that need to defend and convince everyone

229
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:22,750
你对一种编程语言的看法是正确的
that you were right about a programming language?

230
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,000
这样的一种思维是从何而来的呢？
Where does that come from?

231
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,534
我也不知道
I guess, I don't know.

232
00:14:25,534 --> 00:14:27,435
因为我很喜欢你关于笔与作品的比喻 我首先想到的是…
The first thing that came into my head,

233
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:32,000
因为我很喜欢你关于笔与作品的比喻 我首先想到的是…
because I loved your metaphor of the pen versus the output.

234
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,883
在我的设想中 人们死死地抓住工具
I just imagine that some of the output is not that great.

235
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,000
恐怕是因为作品并不吸引人
So the only thing that people can hold on to is the tool.

236
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,000
这就很好笑了
That's hilarious.

237
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:46,763
如果你做的东西就是不厉害 不伟大
If the things you make just aren't awesome and aren't great

238
00:14:46,763 --> 00:14:49,000
对这个世界也没有太大的价值
and don't have a lot of value for the world

239
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:51,563
你还想捍卫你的手艺
and you want to still defend your craft,

240
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:55,531
你唯一能指出的就是 是啊 看我把那把锤子挥得多好
the only thing you can point to is like, yeah, but look how well I swung that hammer.

241
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:57,963
当然 房子虽然倒了
Sure, the house fell apart,

242
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:02,000
但那把锤子 那把锤子真的很棒 我知道怎么用
but that hammer, that hammer is really great and I know how to use it.

243
00:15:02,507 --> 00:15:03,170
你知道
And you know,

244
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,434
我这个人…我也觉得建造出的东西
as someone like, I always was more interested in the things I built

245
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:08,000
比你建造它的方式更重要
than the manner in which I built them.

246
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,870
说得好
That's a good point.

247
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,374
现在 初学者不止可以选择 BASIC 或者 FORTRAN
Now that beginners have more to choose from

248
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:14,678
现在 初学者不止可以选择 BASIC 或者 FORTRAN
than just BASIC or, I don't know, Fortran,

249
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,006
我们已经拥有一整套的入门语言清单
now that we have a whole menu of first languages,

250
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,841
但总有一种危险
there's always the danger

251
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:23,000
那就是你忘记了这些语言仍然是达到目的的一种手段
that you forget these languages are still a means to an end.

252
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:26,646
语言是工具 不是你要制作的东西
The language is the tool. It's not the thing you're making.

253
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:32,201
我认为技术的价值在于 为人们创造有意义的事物
I think that the value of technology is to create meaningful things for people.

254
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,700
说到底 如果你确实是一名非常非常好的程序员
Ultimately, if you're a programmer and you're really, really good,

255
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:42,000
但是你做的东西没有人需要 没有人喜欢…
but you're building things that no one needs and no one likes and, you know

256
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:43,989
它没有为世界增加价值
aren't adding value to the world,

257
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:46,271
但是你真的真的非常擅长这门手艺
but you're really, really good at the craft

258
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:49,471
我想你可能会深入研究并讨论所使用的工具
and you just can't find a way to actually make the impact you want.

259
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,527
我想你可能会深入研究并讨论所使用的工具
I imagine that you'd probably dig in and talk about the tool you used.

260
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,006
非常感谢 Avi
Well, thank you so much, Avi,

261
00:15:57,006 --> 00:16:00,782
感谢你分享你的所有经验以及对编程语言的想法
for sharing all your experiences and your thoughts about programming languages.

262
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:01,676
那我们就谈到这里？
You want to say goodbye?

263
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:04,392
是的 这非常好玩 很高兴再次跟你交流
Yeah, this was super fun. It was nice connecting again.

264
00:16:04,392 --> 00:16:09,768
我希望大家都找到自己喜欢的语言 每天都能用它写代码
And I hope you all find a language that you love and get to work in it every day.

265
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,848
听起来不错
Sounds good.

266
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,584
Avi Flombaum 是 Flatiron 学校的联合创始人之一
Avi Flombaum is one of the co-founders of Flatiron School.

267
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,518
编程学校可以将教育和知识获取的精神提升到一个全新的高度
Coding schools can bring that spirit of access and education to a whole new level.

268
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,526
这是我们在达特茅斯看到的一切的延续
It's a continuation of what we saw at Dartmouth.

269
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,568
但如今 在一个多样化的开发生态系统中
But in a rich development ecosystem,

270
00:16:31,568 --> 00:16:35,472
新的、更加自然的入门方式将会不断涌现
we'll keep getting more and more natural points of entry.

271
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,552
初学者们已经有了更理想的手段来开始他们的编程“游戏”
And first-time coders are already discovering next-level ways to get into the game.

272
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:43,664
有时 他们甚至真是从玩游戏开始的
Sometimes, literally.

273
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,785
你试过其他键吗？试试 G 键
Have you tried like a different key? So, why don't you try the G key?

274
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:53,210
现在 在这暂停
Now, hold on.

275
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,818
这不是一群年轻的程序员在默默地背诵 O'Reilly 的课本
That is not a bunch of young coders silently memorizing an O'Reilly textbook.

276
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,442
也不是在 Flatiron 学校的讲座
And it's not a lecture at the Flatiron School either.

277
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:05,525
这其实是红帽在伦敦泰特现代美术馆里开办的一节实践课
It's actually a little lab that Red Hat ran at the Tate Modern in London.

278
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,469
那些孩子呢？他们在学习写代码
And those kids, they're learning to code.

279
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:12,629
对于新一代来说 编程的乐趣就是他们首先体会到的
For a new generation, the joy of coding is what they first encounter.

280
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:18,133
好的 嗨 我叫 Femi 网名是 Hackerfemo
Okay. Hi, my name is Femi, aka Hackerfemo.
大家可以在 Github 找到他的账号 不过他这两年好像没怎么活动 :(

281
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:21,653
Femi Owolade-Coombes 只有 13 岁
Femi Owolade-Coombes is only 13 years old,

282
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:25,231
但他已经是新一代程序员中的一名领袖
but he's already a leader in a new wave of young coders.

283
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:29,261
我八岁的时候第一次接触到编程
I first encountered coding when I was eight,

284
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:34,445
那时我去约克参加一项活动 活动本身其实是数学主题的
and I went to an event in York, actually, about maths.

285
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:39,754
不过我在那里看到了个很酷的东西 - 合法地黑入 Minecraft
And there, I saw this cool thing, you know, hacking Minecraft, ethically.

286
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,263
作为八岁的孩子 那时候的我认为那真的很酷
And as an eight-year-old, I thought that was really cool.

287
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,804
所以我就这样入门了编程
So that's how I got into coding.

288
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,780
他不是孤例 Minecraft 已经将一代人引入了编程领域
He's not alone. Minecraft has introduced a whole generation to coding.

289
00:17:52,164 --> 00:17:55,812
而且这不需要过去几代人所经历的痛苦和枯燥的学习
And it's done that without any of the pain or dry studying

290
00:17:55,812 --> 00:17:58,000
而且这不需要过去几代人所经历的痛苦和枯燥的学习
that past generations suffered through.

291
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:01,000
游戏的魔力正在消除障碍
The magic of gaming is dropping barriers.

292
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:03,007
Minecraft 是基于 Java 的
Minecraft is Java-based,

293
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:06,399
它也为该语言注入了新的活力
and it's been credited with breathing new life into that language

294
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,367
催生了一大群新的 Java 粉丝
spawning a whole crowd of fresh-faced Java fans.

295
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:12,223
但不一定是 Java
But it doesn't have to be Java.

296
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:16,191
对于 Femi来 说 Python 是他在 Minecraft 中发现的语言
For Femi, Python was the language he discovered in Minecraft.

297
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:21,178
如果你玩的是树莓派版的 Minecraft 你就可以用 Python
You can use Python when you're using the Raspberry Pi in Minecraft

298
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:25,748
因为树莓派上的 Minecraft 是特殊编写的版本 它很酷
because Minecraft have created a special edition for the Raspberry Pi, which is so cool

299
00:18:25,748 --> 00:18:29,350
只要导入这个库 你就可以黑进去
because you can hack it by just importing this, like, library,

300
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,806
到处放置爆炸性的 TNT
and you can put exploding TNT everywhere.

301
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:35,500
你可以在自己身后创建方块
And you can create blocks behind you.

302
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,828
也可以创造建筑物 你可以拿它做各种各样的事
You can create whole buildings, all sorts of things.

303
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:45,250
当我第一次玩它时 我发现可以添加很多类似 mod 的东西
When I first played it, I knew there were quite a few things like mods you could add on,

304
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,506
这也很酷
which are pretty cool.

305
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:48,590
mod 这东西本身就有点像黑进游戏一样
Those were like little hacks in themselves.

306
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,525
但 mod 的存在让我意识到
But this was the first time that I realized you could, like,

307
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:54,890
我们也可以用正规的方法改变游戏 让它以你希望的方式行事
properly hack it and really make it do what you want.

308
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:57,322
我认为这真的很酷
I thought it was really cool.

309
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,010
Femi 打开了一个编程世界
A world of coding opened up for Femi,

310
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:03,422
而通往世界的大门是他最喜欢的游戏
and the door to that world was his favorite game.

311
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,326
然后 他做了一件了不起的事情
And then Femi did something kind of amazing.

312
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:10,206
他开始向其他孩子分享那扇门
He started showing other kids that door.

313
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,325
嗯 我想与同伴分享我的知识
Well, I wanted to share my knowledge with my peers,

314
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:18,445
因为我觉得 你知道吗？他们会非常喜欢的
because I thought, you know what, they will really enjoy this.

315
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,382
我也会因此度过愉快的时光
And I have, and I had a great time,

316
00:19:21,382 --> 00:19:26,000
我想与其他所有人共享这些 这样他们就能了解它
I want to share this with everyone else, so that they can learn about it

317
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,560
甚至可以参与编程
and so that they can even get into coding.

318
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:34,456
Femi 将此事贯彻到底 创办了“南伦敦树莓酱”社团
Femi went ahead and founded the South London Raspberry Jam.
Jam 有即兴演奏的意思

319
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,256
在那里 他已经看到了全新一代的编程者
And there, he's been able to watch a whole new generation of coders

320
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:44,000
他们正挑战人们以往对编程初体验的预判
defy expectations about what a first language experience should look like.

321
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:46,616
除了“黑进 Minecraft”之外
Besides those Minecraft hacks,

322
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:49,240
像 Scratch 或 Fruit 这样的可视化语言
visual languages like Scratch or Fruit

323
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,000
也让越来越年轻的用户拥有基础知识可以实现编程
are making the basics of coding achievable to younger and younger users.

324
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:56,329
我确实喜欢玩游戏这个点子
I do like the idea of playing a game,

325
00:19:56,329 --> 00:20:00,873
比起在课堂上学习代码 我肯定更想在游戏里学习
and I most certainly do it over, you know, learning to code in a classroom.

326
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:06,505
我最喜欢的是能够控制游戏中发生的事情
But it's the idea of, you know, being able to control what happens in that game.

327
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:08,500
而代码是背后的魔法
And code is behind that,

328
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:14,132
代码给了你那种非常酷的能力 让游戏做你想要的事情
and code gives you that really cool ability to make the game do what you want.

329
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:17,588
Femi 的妈妈告诉我们
Femi's mom told us how happy she was

330
00:20:17,588 --> 00:20:21,000
当她发现玩游戏并非一种弊大于利的追求时 她有多么高兴
to discover that gaming didn't have to be a passive pursuit.

331
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:26,676
我喜欢他的故事 因为这故事是从游戏开始的 却没有结束于游戏
What I love about his story is that it starts with gaming, sure, but it doesn't end there.

332
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,004
他建立了一个属于年轻程序员的、了不起的社区
He built an amazing community of young coders,

333
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:32,820
Femi 自己的代码生涯也在起飞
and Femi's own coding life is taking off.

334
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,316
不再是围绕着 Minecraft 了
It's not just Minecraft anymore.

335
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,675
他学会了使用 HTML、JavaScript 和 CSS
He works in HTML, JavaScript and CSS,

336
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:41,000
建立网站 做网页设计
building websites and doing Web design.

337
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:44,406
他甚至在用 Unity 打造自己的游戏
He's even building his own games using Unity.

338
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,590
每个人都应该有权利学习编程 因为这是未来
Everyone really should have a right to learn how to code because it is the future.

339
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:56,822
Minecraft 真的是一所巨型编程大学吗？
So is Minecraft really a giant programming university?

340
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,300
明日的程序员 是否会通过游戏和玩耍来吸收新的语言呢？
Are the coders of tomorrow going to absorb new languages

341
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,000
明日的程序员 是否会通过游戏和玩耍来吸收新的语言呢？
through games and simply messing around?

342
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:06,316
只通过环境渗透能否真正地学习语言？
Will languages be learned just through osmosis?

343
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,236
嗨 我叫 Robyn Bergeron
Hi, my name is Robyn Bergeron.
是第二季番外篇请到过的人:)

344
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:12,000
Robyn 是红帽的 Ansible 社区架构师
Robyn's the community architect for Ansible over at Red Hat.

345
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,827
她有几个孩子
And she also happens to have a couple kids

346
00:21:14,827 --> 00:21:17,259
这些孩子们偶然间接触到了编程
who've stumbled into programming themselves.

347
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,100
那是晚饭时刻
So there was a moment at dinner one night.

348
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,115
我在做饭
I was actually cooking.

349
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,000
每个人对这件事情都印象深刻
Everyone was impressed.

350
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,670
我的女儿来到厨房 她说:
My daughter came into the kitchen area and she said,

351
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,550
“妈妈 我给 Minecraft 提交了一个 bug！”
Mommy, I filed a bug in Minecraft.

352
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,408
我从事软件工作
You know, I work in software.

353
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:33,312
我看到过很多很多错误报告
I get to see lots, you know, lots and lots and lots of bug reports.

354
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:38,900
我真的很好奇 她这么讲究竟是什么意思
And I was just really curious about what that meant in that universe, right?

355
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:44,276
是说我在推特上和别人聊了聊 说它坏了 还是什么？
Is that like, you know, I've talked to someone on Twitter and said it's broken or what?

356
00:21:45,192 --> 00:21:46,528
我让她给我看看
And I asked her to show me.

357
00:21:46,528 --> 00:21:49,152
于是她打开了电脑
So she opened up, you know, her computer

358
00:21:49,152 --> 00:21:53,184
她已经在 Mojang 的系统中创建了一个 Jira 帐户
and she had created a Jira account in Mojang system.

359
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,000
我们应该注意到 Robyn 的女儿在当时只有 11 岁
We should note Robyn's daughter was 11 when she did this.

360
00:21:57,536 --> 00:21:59,809
她把表格填得像模像样
She had filled out their form exactly.

361
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:03,475
我见过很多内容不完整的错误报告
And, you know, I see lots of bug reports that are not well formed

362
00:22:03,475 --> 00:22:05,757
也见过很多口吻过于尖锐的错误报告
or they're very mean. I see a lot of that too.

363
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,701
但这是一个完美的报告…这份报告里有说“发生了什么事”
But it was a perfectly, you know, here's what happened.

364
00:22:08,975 --> 00:22:10,450
“我预期会发生什么事”
Here's what I expected to happen.

365
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,569
以及“如何重现错误”
And here's all of the steps to reproduce,

366
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,725
对于很多人来说 这是他们与项目的第一次互动
which is, you know, for a lot of people that's their first interaction with any project,

367
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:19,389
无论是商业的
whether it's a, you know, commercial

368
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:22,048
专有的软件项目 比如一个电子游戏
you know, proprietary software project like a video game

369
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:24,352
还是一个开源软件项目
or a open source software project.

370
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:27,000
我很自豪
And I was so proud.

371
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,700
我告诉她 之后我们完全可以去参加 Minecraft 大会
And I told her we could totally go to the Minecraft conference after that

372
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,200
因为他们一直很想去
because they had been dying to go.

373
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,498
Robyn 意识到 当我们其他人从事日常工作时
Robyn was about to realize that while the rest of us were going about our day jobs

374
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:40,122
孩子们却开始了一场革命
the kids were starting a revolution.

375
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,554
以下是在那场 Minecraft 大会上发生的事情
Here's what happened at that conference.

376
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,550
我们去参加主题演讲 我说 就算我们排在最后进去也没事的
We went to the keynotes and I said, oh, we'll go at the last second.

377
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,510
会在第二排找到位置
We'll be fine.

378
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,000
会在第二排找到位置
We'll totally be like in the second row.

379
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,494
完全错了
Oh, no.

380
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,748
大错特错
No, no, no.

381
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:55,228
我们坐得就跟房间后面那 10 个大屏幕一样靠后
We were like 10 of those gigantic big screens back in the room.

382
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,940
不过这并没有减少孩子们的热情
But it was nonstop cool stuff for kids.

383
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,425
大会的其中一天 全体开发人员也出场了 这可把孩子们激动坏了
And they had a moment on one of the days where they brought out all of the developers.

384
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:04,339
当工程师们出来的时候
And when the engineers came out,

385
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,640
所有在场的孩子都站起来尖叫
literally every kid in this audience was like standing on their chair screaming.

386
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,160
如果你看过披头士乐队表演的视频
Like if you've ever seen a, here's the Beatles,

387
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,550
那时候就像披头士乐队来美国时一样
like the Beatles come to America video.

388
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:13,875
那时候就像披头士乐队来美国时一样

389
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:14,550
那时候就像披头士乐队来美国时一样
It was like that.

390
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:19,275
粉丝们就好像是“我没办法相信 他们就在我们眼前 他们太棒了”
I mean, it was like, I can't believe we're like near them and they're amazing.

391
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:21,350
在讲演期间
And, you know, during the sessions,

392
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,370
人们都在试图得到他们的签名
people were trying to get their autographs and it was,

393
00:23:23,882 --> 00:23:26,186
这是…我和我的孩子坐在那里
you know, I'm sitting there with my kids being like

394
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:30,850
我在想 我开发操作系统 连接互联网
I work on operating systems that connect the Internet

395
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,690
这样你们才能在一起玩游戏吧？
so that you guys can actually game together.

396
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,575
我们做错了什么 才会如此默默无闻呢？
What are we doing wrong?

397
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:37,700
但是孩子们就像
But, you know, kids are just being like,

398
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,850
我长大后要成为使用 JavaScript 的人！
I'm going to be a JavaScript person when I grow up.

399
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,525
我长大后要成为使用 JavaScript 的人！
Yes.

400
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:48,000
是的 那个活动带来的热烈氛围令人着迷
And, you know, just watching the level of enthusiasm at that event was fascinating.

401
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
但…这是一个电子游戏
But it's a video game.

402
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,832
在 70 年代的某一段时间
There was a time back in the seventies

403
00:23:54,024 --> 00:23:56,584
每个人的入门语言都是 BASIC
when everyone's first language was BASIC.

404
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,632
然后可能是 C
And then maybe it was C.

405
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
近来 人们开始使用 Java 或 Python
More recently, people have been starting with Java or Python.

406
00:24:03,368 --> 00:24:05,608
但是可视化语言编程和游戏
But visual languages and games

407
00:24:05,608 --> 00:24:10,000
正在催生我们鲜有设想的编程未来
are ushering in a coding future that we're only beginning to imagine.

408
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,312
尽管对于已经从事多年编程工作的人来说 这似乎微不足道
Even though it may seem trivial to someone who's been programming for years,

409
00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:17,937
但我开始游玩的那一刻
it's, you know, like that first moment of, I'm playing.

410
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:20,232
我甚至没有意识到 我其实是在学习一种
And I don't even realize that I'm actually learning something

411
00:24:20,232 --> 00:24:21,768
可以让我受益终生的东西
that could turn into a lifelong skill.

412
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,000
Robyn Bergeron 是红帽的 Ansible 社区架构师

413
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,820
BASIC 邀请大学生进入编程世界
BASIC invited college students into the world of programming.

414
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:40,876
而 Minecraft 等游戏则邀请小学生进入当今的编程世界
And games like Minecraft invite elementary school students into that world today.

415
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:46,252
但是从某种意义上说 创造的动力并没有改变
But in a way, the creative impulse behind all of this hasn't changed.

416
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,748
那些大学生在学习 BASIC？
Those college kids exploring BASIC.

417
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:51,954
是的 他们经常用它来编写游戏
Yeah, they were often using it to build their own games.

418
00:24:52,175 --> 00:24:54,514
最常见的似乎是足球题材
Lots of fantasy football, apparently.

419
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
创新精神是驱使我们学习编程语言的第一推动力
Our creative spirit is what drives us toward programming languages in the first place.

420
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:05,202
这种驱动力让我们使世界变得更好 或变得更加有趣
That drive to tweak the world, make it better or just more fun.

421
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:10,066
下次 在第 3 集中
Next time in episode three,

422
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:14,000
我们会讲述 全新的编程语言究竟从何而来？
where do brand new programming languages come from anyway?

423
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:16,846
我们会了解到 巨大挑战
We're learning how incredible challenges

424
00:25:17,075 --> 00:25:20,467
是如何推动着开发人员从过去的语言中走出来
push developers to walk away from the languages of yesterday

425
00:25:20,595 --> 00:25:23,000
并在今天创造出新事物的
and build something totally new today.

426
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,706
