00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:15,443
2012 年 8 月 6 日
On August 6, 2012,

2
00:00:15,443 --> 00:00:18,901
一枚汽车大小的漫游车 好奇号
a car-size rover called Curiosity

3
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:23,523
从火星大气的顶层降落到了这颗星球的地表
fell from the top of the Martian atmosphere to the planet's surface.

4
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,555
降落花了 7 分钟
The fall took seven minutes.

5
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:28,100
下降的过程…
Down,

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,375
…仿佛永无止境
down.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,423
漫游车携带着贵重的货物：
The rover carried a precious cargo,

8
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:35,878
50万行代码
500,000 lines of code,

9
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:38,775
76 台尖端科学仪器
76 pyrotechnic devices,

10
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:43,847
以及另一些工具 用以开展前所未有的实验
and a series of tools for conducting never-before-possible experiments.

11
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:46,975
先是超音速降落伞展开
After releasing a supersonic parachute,

12
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:49,550
接着是隔热护盾分离
after heat shield separation,

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,180
然后 反冲发动机启动
after power descent,

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,868
甚至在半空中部署天车 -
and even a sky crane deployment in mid-air,

15
00:00:56,425 --> 00:01:00,025
最终 好奇号平稳着陆
Curiosity at last touched down.

16
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,093
现在 是时候看看“好奇号”会将我们带向何方了
"Time to see where Curiosity will take us."

17
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,257
听见那声音了吗？
Hear that sound?

18
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:19,585
那就是火星车成功着陆后 满屋子工程师的欢呼声
That's what it sounds like when a room full of engineers land a rover on Mars.

19
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:25,645
几天后 他们将收到来自贝拉克·奥巴马总统的贺电
In a few days, they'll be getting a congrats phone call from President Barack Obama.

20
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:28,133
但现在是只属于他们的时刻
But for now it's all about the team.

21
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:32,871
房间里的这群人 一同完成的事
A room full of people who know they've just accomplished something together

22
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:35,383
是他们中的任何一人永远都无法独自做到的
that they could never have accomplished on their own.

23
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:41,259
我是 Saron Yitbarek
I'm Saron Yitbarek,

24
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:45,371
这里是代码英雄 由红帽提供的原创播客节目
and this is Command Line Heroes, an original podcast from Red Hat.

25
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:48,230
本季以来
All season long,

26
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,618
我们见证了开源技术对我们工作方式的重塑
we've seen how open source technology remakes the way we work

27
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:54,821
及其对人们能力的拓展
and what we're capable of accomplishing.

28
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:58,750
作为线索 社区这个要素贯穿了整季节目
The through-line for me has always been community.

29
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,013
这些故事告诉我们该怎么团队协作
It's always about discovering better ways to work together,

30
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:05,256
该怎么向行家学习
better ways to learn from the pros,

31
00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:07,729
以及 如何在这同时学会听取新人的意见
while listening to fresh voices, too.

32
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:10,177
一言以蔽之 如何更好地与人交流
Better ways to connect.

33
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:12,919
在第二季的终章
For our season two finale,

34
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,622
在记住所有这些道理的同时
we're holding on to all those lessons,

35
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:20,525
我们将探索开源是如何为那些伟大的项目赋能的
while we discover how open source powers some of our grandest projects.

36
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:23,455
你也许在去年的十一月
You might've been watching last November

37
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:27,453
观看了 NASA 的“洞察号”登陆器抵达火星地表
when NASA's InSight Lander touched down on the surface of Mars.

38
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:29,229
彼时四周皆是欢呼与拥抱
Hugs all around.

39
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,470
事实证明
Well, it turns out that

40
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,535
向星星 - 向这颗红色的星球发射漫游车的任务
shooting for the stars or the red planet only works

41
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:37,750
只有把宝押在众人合作上 才能完成
when you bet everything on collaboration.

42
00:02:44,175 --> 00:02:48,625
我刚才说过了吗？那台火星车有它自己的推特账号
Did I mention that rover on Mars has its own Twitter account?

43
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:50,925
它还有四百万粉丝呢
Four million followers.

44
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:51,803
这还不算什么
No big deal.

45
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:55,147
最近它给地球人发送了一条推文
And it recently tweeted a message to earthlings,

46
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,100
是一封邀请函
an invitation to build a rover of their own,

47
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:01,508
邀请人们使用 NASA 喷气动力实验室开源的说明和代码
complete with open source instructions and code,

48
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:04,532
建造一辆属于自己的漫游车
courtesy of NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab.

49
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:08,962
我们跟踪采访了一个民间的组织 叫 SGVHAK 小组
We caught up with some folks called the SGVHAK Group.

50
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:11,962
他们是第一批自己建造漫游车的人
They're one of the first to build their own rover.

51
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,750
现在我要试试从坎上开过去
I'm gonna try and drive over that curb.

52
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,159
看看她这样能不能行
Let's see what she can do.

53
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,287
上来了 - - 不 不行
Going up. Nope.

54
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:18,870
不行
No.

55
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,463
她以前很容易就能开过去的
She used to be able to go over pretty easily,

56
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:24,911
不过我们现在对轮子做了一些改动
but with the changes we've made to the wheels,

57
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:26,665
她就有点不乐意了
she's a little reluctant now.

58
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:30,649
这个小组的成员包括 Roger Cheng、Dave Flynn
The group includes Roger Cheng, Dave Flynn, Emily Velasco, and Lan Dang.

59
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:33,273
Emily Velasco 以及 Lan Dang
The group includes Roger Cheng, Dave Flynn, Emily Velasco, and Lan Dang.

60
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:36,024
Dave 包揽了所有机械设计
Dave designs all the mechanical stuff,

61
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:37,490
我想我应该算是负责整合的
and I guess I put things together.

62
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:41,450
Roger 是我们的程序员
oger's our software guy, Dave's design,

63
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,174
Lan 是我们无畏的领导
Lan is our fearless leader, so.

64
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,448
你也有东西的
You are the one,

65
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:49,344
你是队里的机械制造专家
you're the mechanical fabrication expert on the team.

66
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:50,866
大概吧 应该算是
I guess. I guess so.

67
00:03:50,994 --> 00:03:53,275
跟他们讲讲伺服电机架子的事
Tell people about the servo bracket.

68
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,087
噢 好的
Oh right.
You're the one that built the servo cluge that
是你把电机凑起来的

69
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:56,941
You're the one that built the servo cluge that
是你把电机凑起来的

70
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:58,460
run it... the show.
让它运行 演示一下

71
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:03,778
打造这样一部漫游车可不像拼装乐高积木
Building one of these rovers isn't exactly a Lego project.

72
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:09,644
它需要真正的火箭科学家花 200 小时来完成
It takes actual rocket scientists about 200 hours to complete.

73
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:14,268
所以 让我们给这些家伙几分钟的准备时间
So yeah, let's give these guys a few minutes to get their act together.

74
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,705
稍后再回来
We'll check in with them later.

75
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:22,443
与此同时 我想了解更多
Meanwhile, I wanted to learn more about

76
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:26,491
关于为什么当初 NASA 要将漫游车的技术和代码向全世界开源
why NASA gave the world an open source rover in the first place.

77
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,530
我恰好找到了回答这个问题的最佳人选
And I found just the person to ask.

78
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,875
我叫 Tom Soderstorm
My name is Tom Soderstrom.

79
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:36,139
我是 NASA 喷气推进实验室的 IT 部门的首席技术与创新官
I am chief technology and innovation officer for IT at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
喷气推进实验室 = Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)

80
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:41,275
JPL 总共有大约 6000 人
JPL is a group of about 6,000 people.

81
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:44,299
它是 NASA 的研究中心之一 由联邦政府提供资金
It's NASA's federally-funded research center,

82
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:47,805
专注于研究如何用无人机械进行太空探索
and they focus on robotic exploration in space.

83
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,925
我们寻找地外生命
We look for is there life out there?

84
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:53,025
我们也探究宇宙的起源和未来
How did the universe originate, where is it going?

85
00:04:53,537 --> 00:04:56,555
除此之外 考虑到可能的星际移民需求
And in addition to that, should we ever need to export humanity,

86
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:58,575
我们也在寻找地球 2.0
we're trying to find Earth 2.0.

87
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:03,007
也就是具有类似地球的环境的、另一个适宜人类居住的行星
The earth-like planets that one day we could inhabit.

88
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,635
是的 他们肩负着伟大的使命
Yeah, it's the big leagues.

89
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:07,925
不过 事情是这样的
But here's the thing.

90
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:08,160
But here's the thing.

91
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:12,080
Tom 的团队并不是一群闭门造车的工程师
Tom's team isn't some siloed group of engineers.

92
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:16,975
他们与下一代的科学家们有着深厚的联系
They're deeply committed to connecting with the next generation of scientists.

93
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:21,700
他们常常采用全新的方式激发大众的创造性思维
They're constantly trying to find new ways to spark original thinking.

94
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:24,596
事实上 这是他们工作中至关重要的一部分
In fact, it's a crucial part of their job.

95
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,708
漫游车开源计划释放出了部分设计
The open source rover project gives away those designs,

96
00:05:28,964 --> 00:05:33,268
这样一来 NASA 之外的民间组织就能组建他们自己的漫游车了
so teams of non-NASA folk can try building their own rover.

97
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:37,572
这是 NASA 促进创新的宏观战略的一部分
That was part of NASA's larger strategy to promote innovation.

98
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:43,220
很自然地 Tom 从开源漫游车开始
Tom and I got talking about why open sourcing NASA's work is so important.

99
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:46,673
向我讲述了为何开源 NASA 的成果是如此重要
Starting naturally with that open source rover.

100
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:48,735
有很多人可能像我一样
A lot of people are,

101
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:49,925
发现这个网站时 我想
but when I found this site, I'm like,

102
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:52,300
天啊 也许我可以自己打造一个漫游车呢
oh man, maybe I can make a rover.

103
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,050
这真是太激动人心了 这太令人神往了
It's really exciting. It's really engaging.

104
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,563
我们打造这个开源网站 是为了能让公众和学校能够从中学习
We built it for the public and schools to learn,

105
00:05:58,563 --> 00:06:00,293
而且我们发现
and we're realizing that as we did,

106
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,895
围绕漫游车开源形成的社区是非常优秀的实验平台
it's becoming a wonderful experimentation platform for us.

107
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,007
所以当我们想测试新鲜事物的时候 这里就是最佳的演练场
So as we try new things, it's the best place to try it,

108
00:06:08,263 --> 00:06:10,090
非常简单 非常高效
very easy, very quick,

109
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,213
我们能很快就把想要的技术应用到真正的漫游车上
and then we can put it on the real rovers.

110
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,848
所以我们希望人们能够把像太阳能面板、
So we're hoping that people will incorporate things like solar panels,

111
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:18,488
加速度传感器、科学实验仪器、
accelerometers, the science payloads,

112
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,704
以及先进的人工智能程序等结合起来
very advanced artificial intelligence programming,

113
00:06:21,704 --> 00:06:25,752
我们只是希望这些经验能够扩散
and we just want the experiences to proliferate

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,176
在这些方面感兴趣的人最终也能对太空感兴趣
and the people get interested in this and eventually interested in space.

115
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:31,587
因为太空真的是太酷了
Because space is way cool.

116
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:34,500
所以除了刚才提到的这些之外
So besides the ideas that you have listed,

117
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,363
人们在这个项目中还做过哪些
things that people can do,

118
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:41,819
让你印象深刻的 或者是让你觉得激动的事儿？
what have people done with it that you were really excited about or impressed by

119
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:45,511
降价是一项非常令人印象深刻的工作
The price reduction was one really impressive thing

120
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:48,407
而现在有一堆人在试着用人工智能干这个事儿
and right now, there's a lot of artificial intelligence (AI) going on.

121
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,325
这是目前我见到的最有趣的事情之一
So that's one of the most interesting things I see coming.

122
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:54,285
我很想看到有人能为漫游车添加一个机械臂
I would love to see somebody add a robot arm to it.

123
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:55,550
真是太酷了
Really cool.

124
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,550
这也是我们正在研究的问题之一
And something we're thinking about.

125
00:06:57,975 --> 00:07:03,400
这个项目是全方位开放的吗？
So it sounds like this project is open on all angles, right?

126
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,450
我是指 对于硬件部分 你们给出了一份推荐的零部件清单
I mean the hardware is a list of parts that are suggested

127
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,150
但参与者如果愿意 也能自行替换 换成更便宜的
and it sounds like you can use your own thing, make it cheaper,

128
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,850
或者换成更贵的
make it more expensive also, I guess if you wanted to.

129
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,105
而软件部分就完全是开源的了
The software is completely open.

130
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,561
这中间有任何非开源的部分吗？
Is there any part of this that isn't (open)?

131
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:18,953
没有 完全是开源的
No, it's all completely open.

132
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:20,846
如果你告诉我
So what's really amazing about this is

133
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:25,243
高中生都能通过这个项目自行制作漫游车 我会觉得非常震惊
if you told me that high school students could build their own rovers,

134
00:07:25,755 --> 00:07:27,215
那听起来太难了
that would just sound too difficult,

135
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:29,675
你懂得 听起来太高端了
you know, that sounds so advanced.

136
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:32,318
高到只有 NASA 才会去做的那种
It sounds like something that only NASA would do. Right?

137
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:35,965
真正地组装火星车会是件容易的事吗？
How simple is it really to put together?

138
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:37,965
我们并不想将这做成一个玩具
So it's not meant to be a toy.

139
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,000
这个项目是货真价实的
It's meant to be something real,

140
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,725
能给参与者带来实际的经验
that really gives them the real experience.

141
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:45,975
加利福尼亚州的几所学校已经将其
So several schools in California have already adopted it,

142
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:52,391
纳入他们的科学、工程与编程课程中
to put it into their science and engineering and programming program.

143
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,722
比如所谓的机械电子学
Something called Mechatronics, for instance,

144
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:55,929
就是上述几方面的结合体
where it combines all of them.

145
00:07:56,313 --> 00:07:58,209
这让我们非常高兴
And that makes us very happy,

146
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:03,725
因为这样 在不久的将来就能有一批训练有素的专业人才来到 NASA
because then we will get better trained people coming into NASA at one point.

147
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:08,821
但这似乎不仅有利于未来的 NASA 工程师
But it sounds like at this point it's not only benefiting these future NASA people,

148
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,578
未来的科学家
these future scientists,

149
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:12,422
也有利于你们
but it's also benefiting you.

150
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,913
跟我多说说这方面吧
Tell me a little bit more about that.

151
00:08:13,913 --> 00:08:14,901
嗯…突然间
So all of a sudden,

152
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:18,486
我们就有了一个非常简单易用的实验平台
we have now a very simple platform to experiment with.

153
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:24,686
我能想象到开源的漫游车在 JPL 附近行驶 跟人打招呼
So I can envision the open source rover driving around JPL and saying hello to people.

154
00:08:24,814 --> 00:08:28,158
在于艰苦环境中验证某些技术之前
So we can experiment very quickly in our own backyard

155
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:32,718
我们能在后院里对它们快速地进行试验
on things that we would later on need to take to much more difficult places.

156
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:37,337
它成为了我们可以实验的移动平台
So, it becomes a mobile platform that we can experiment with.

157
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:41,216
话又说回来 我认为人工智能会是这些技术中非常有趣的一样
And again, I think AI is going to be the interesting one,

158
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,740
因为它发展得太快了
because it's exploding so quickly,

159
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:48,740
给开源漫游车添加新的机械组件很容易 这也相当重要
and the simplicity of adding new robotics parts to it is another factor.

160
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,577
所以 理论上来说
So, theoretically you could have created your own mobile playground,

161
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:55,200
你们也可以创建一个你们自己的移动试验场
So, theoretically you could have created your own mobile playground,

162
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,275
可以进行试验 也不用将其开源 对吧？
a place to experiment and not made it open source, right?

163
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:01,013
它本来可以成为一个内部项目
It could have just been like an internal thing.

164
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:05,150
但它现在是开源的
How has the fact that it's been open source

165
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:08,203
这能让你们多学到什么呢？
affected what you've been able to learn?

166
00:09:08,723 --> 00:09:10,301
嗯 这是一个好问题
So, that's a really good question.

167
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:12,033
为什么要开源？
Why open source?

168
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:15,286
对我们来说 开源才是更困难的选择
For us, it was more difficult to make it open source,

169
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:17,970
不过那也是挑战所在
but that's kind of the challenge.

170
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:19,515
我们希望 通过将其开源
So we wanted to make it open source

171
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:22,287
学校以及其他民间组织能够用上代码 并且将漫游车造出来
so that other schools and all that could adopt it and build it.

172
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:27,181
编写一本不是机器人学专家的人也能看懂的手册
It created a lot more work to create a manual that other people could use

173
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,338
带来了大量额外的工作
who are not already robotics experts.

174
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,364
但起码
But the bottom line is,

175
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:33,674
当我们最终将一些东西真正开源的时候
I think when we release something into open source,

176
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,466
它变得更整洁、更紧凑、文档更完善了
it's cleaner, it's tighter, it's better-documented,

177
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,350
因为我们知道 其他人会来使用这些东西
because people know other people are going to reuse this,

178
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,490
所以也必须要具备一定的可扩展性
and it has to be built to be extended.

179
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,305
因此 项目的质量提高了
So the quality is higher.

180
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,475
我曾经和 Netflix 的人谈过 他们也有同样的感觉
I talked to Netflix, and they had found the same thing,

181
00:09:48,475 --> 00:09:51,243
被开源的代码
that the code, once it was released open source,

182
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:52,050
普遍更加整洁、质量更好
was cleaner.

183
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,350
普遍更加整洁、质量更好

184
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,327
普遍更加整洁、质量更好
It was better.

185
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,480
你是怎样看待开源漫游车的？
When you think about these open source rovers,

186
00:09:57,672 --> 00:10:00,568
五年 十年 甚至将来的二十多年后
5-, 10-, maybe even 20-plus years from now,

187
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:03,926
你觉得它们能做什么
how do you see the things that they're able to do

188
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:06,188
而人们能够创造出什么？
and what people have been able to create?

189
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,916
你认为这些能为身处地球的我们带来什么潜在利好？
How do you see that possibly benefiting us here on earth?

190
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:12,421
能带来多方面的利好
In many, many ways.

191
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:16,341
现在的漫游车被设计成使用轮子行驶
So, today this rover is built to roll.

192
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:20,773
我可以说 它其实也可以被设计成采用步行
I can see that it could be built to walk.

193
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:22,865
也可以对它进行扩展 加上跳跃的功能
It could be extended to hop.

194
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:26,999
我们已经送了一架直升飞机上火星
We're already sending a helicopter to Mars,

195
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:28,054
它现在还在飞着
it's flying right now.

196
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,075
所以说 这些漫游车并不仅仅局限于现在我们所说的漫游车
So these rovers are not just rovers of today.

197
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:35,984
有了全世界各地人们的实验
Having people worldwide experiment with it

198
00:10:35,984 --> 00:10:39,840
我们能走得更快 更远 不断探寻可能性的上限
can help us move much, much faster to see what's possible,

199
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,167
并提出一些我们可能没有想到的想法
and come up with ideas that frankly we might not have thought of.

200
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:45,924
未来到底会是什么样的？
So what will it look like?

201
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:47,250
我迫切地想了解
I can't wait to see.

202
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:48,707
不过我不知道
I don't know.

203
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:50,450
通过创造这个平台
By creating this platform,

204
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:55,075
你们已经为许多人提供了打造自己的“玩具”的机会
you've kind of enabled and empowered a lot of people to make a lot of toys,

205
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:56,625
接下来就让我们拭目以待吧
and then we'll see what turns up.

206
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,150
是的 这是很重要的一点
Yes, and that's actually a very strong point,

207
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,226
因为我发现 凡是我能想到的主意
because what I have noticed is if I can even think of something,

208
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:03,585
都已经有前人做过了
somebody is already doing it.

209
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:05,287
但我们需要找到这些人
It's a matter of finding them,

210
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:08,221
无论我们最开始做的是什么
and whatever we came up with to start,

211
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,485
一旦到最终用户手上
once the end users get their hands on it,

212
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:12,125
他们就能以我们无法想象的方式将其改进十倍
they're gonna improve it tenfold,

213
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,250
他们就能以我们无法想象的方式将其改进十倍
in ways that we never even imagined.

214
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:16,800
所以 向大众开放一些这样的“玩具” 任他们自由发挥
So giving them toys to play with

215
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,046
他们会因此而得到锻炼 社区氛围会变好
makes for a much stronger and better place with more advanced missions in the future.

216
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:23,073
这对将来使用更先进技术的任务也大有益处
makes for a much stronger and better place with more advanced missions in the future.

217
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:23,841
这真是太棒了
Beautiful.

218
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:32,533
如果你想了解开源漫游车项目
If you feel like getting in on the open source rover mission,

219
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:39,013
你可以访问 opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov
you can find out how at opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov.

220
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,383
你能在那儿玩个尽兴
There is so much fun to be had there.

221
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:44,791
我们稍后再与 Tom Soderstrom 进行更多讨论
We'll return for more with Tom Soderstrom.

222
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:46,062
但首先
But first,

223
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:50,835
让我们来更深入地挖掘 NASA 与开源之间的关系
I want us to dig a bit deeper into NASA's relationship with open source.

224
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:53,412
大家好 我是 Hila Lifshitz-Assaf
Hi, I'm Hila Lifshitz-Assaf.

225
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,436
纽约大学商学院的教授
I'm a professor at Stern School of Business, NYU.

226
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:00,981
Hila 正在研究 NASA 是如何打破知识壁垒的
Hila's been studying how NASA breaks down knowledge barriers.

227
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:04,791
如果你能够回到过去 回到 15 世纪
If you go back, even to 15th century,

228
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:08,711
看看那些孤独的发明家 就比如莱昂纳多·达芬奇
and you think about lone inventors, likeLeonardo da Vinci and others,

229
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:12,284
他们某种程度上只在当地社区活动
they were kind of connected only in their local communities.

230
00:12:12,284 --> 00:12:15,367
之后 有了工业革命 有了实验室
And then, we had the industrial revolution and the birth of the lab.

231
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:20,887
此后的两百多年里 人们都在实验室里工作
And ever since, for 200 years or more, people have been working in their labs.

232
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:23,532
最大的变化发生在 21 世纪
And the big change that's happened in the 21st century

233
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:25,783
数字革命之后
with the digital revolution that we're experiencing

234
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:29,000
我们有了开源的概念
has brought up things like open source,

235
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:33,496
而它打破了之前这类组织结构的边界
which are debunking the need for those organizational boundaries that we had.

236
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:39,528
在 NASA 的工作方式中 Hila 见证了这种剧变的典型例子
In NASA's work, Hila sees a prime example of that massive change.

237
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,959
NASA 最吸引我的一点在于
One of the things that attracted me about NASA was

238
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,299
他们就某种意义上来说是最勇敢的
that they were the bravest

239
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:47,826
因为他们勇于接受战略性的研究与开发挑战
in the sense that they really took strategic R&D challenges,

240
00:12:47,826 --> 00:12:50,250
他们的科学家、工程师 最优秀的一批人才
that their scientists and engineers and top brains

241
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,210
为此而努力工作 并使这些挑战向大众开放
were working at the same time and opened them to the crowd.

242
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:55,443
而且 我必须说 直到现在
And I have to say that still to today,

243
00:12:55,443 --> 00:13:00,200
很多其他的组织在做开源科学或是众包的时候
many other organizations, when they do open source science or crowdsourcing,

244
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,950
他们不会把最核心的、战略性的难题交给社区
they do not take their core strategic challenges.

245
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,894
而是只开放一些次要的任务
They take something that is on the side,

246
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:06,933
无论成功还是失败 这都不会让他们的组织蒙受多大损失
that doesn't risk their organization too much,

247
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,023
无论成功还是失败 这都不会让他们的组织蒙受多大损失
whether it succeeds or fails,

248
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:13,175
而 NASA 做的事情 一旦成功了 就真的改变了一切
and NASA did something that really changed things, once it succeeded.

249
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,923
自 2009 年起 NASA 就开始使用
Starting back in 2009, NASA began using

250
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,699
像 Innocentive 和 Topcoder 这样的
open innovation platforms,

251
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:21,825
开源创新平台
like Innocentive and Topcoder.

252
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,596
而且 他们不是闹着玩的
And they weren't playing around.

253
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,135
就像 Hila 所提到的
Like Hila mentioned,

254
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:29,308
他们甚至把核心的 R&D 难题都放了上去
they were putting their top R &D challenges on those platforms.

255
00:13:29,564 --> 00:13:31,086
这些问题上传之后 甚至没过一年
It didn't even took a full year

256
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:34,400
我们就已经陆续开始看到来自众包平台的解决方案
to see solutions starting to come from crowdsourcing platforms.

257
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:38,529
这确实很快 我将在此举出一项研究成果
Real quick, I want to give you just one of the home runs they got

258
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:40,529
它是 NASA 开源科研的诸多喜人硕果之一
from opening up their research.

259
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:42,301
Hila 将向我们讲述
Hila's gonna describe

260
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:46,063
他们是如何将太阳耀斑的预测技术提升一个台阶的
how they were able to level-up their solar flare prediction.

261
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,251
嗯…太阳耀斑的预测是个太阳物理学难题
So, predicting solar storms is a hard heliophysics problem

262
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:53,175
学术界已经在此事上花费了十年有余
that people have been working on it for more than a decade.

263
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:56,323
总的来说 他们已经完成初步的构想
And basically they formulated it in a way

264
00:13:56,643 --> 00:14:00,506
以便更多的人可以参与这方面的研究
that was able to be solved by a wide area of people.

265
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,139
而且他们就是冲着这个来的
And they were very intentional about it.

266
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,221
这让我觉得很惊奇
That's the amazing thing that I found

267
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:08,100
因为他们居然真的希望能从太阳物理学圈子外的人那里找到解决方案
that they were trying to get solutions from people outside of heliophysics.

268
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,049
因为他们居然真的希望能从太阳物理学圈子外的人那里找到解决方案
They were really looking for an innovative solution.

269
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:12,000
Bruce Kragan 是一名半退休的无线电工程师
And indeed,

270
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,097
Bruce Kragan 是一名半退休的无线电工程师
Bruce Kragan, a semi-retired radio engineer from rural New Hampshire,

271
00:14:15,097 --> 00:14:16,225
他来自新罕布什尔州乡下
Bruce Kragan, a semi-retired radio engineer from rural New Hampshire,

272
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:19,827
只过了三个月 他就给我们带来了太阳耀斑的预测方法
in 3 months brought us solutions that predicted solar flares.

273
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:21,301
当 NASA 验证模型时
And when the NASA folks ran it,

274
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:23,848
他们发现 这种预测方法的准确率有 80%
they actually saw that he predicted at 80%.

275
00:14:24,175 --> 00:14:26,425
用传统方式需要花费数百万美元、数年时间才能获取的成果
So basically, something that in the traditional model

276
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:28,425
用传统方式需要花费数百万美元、数年时间才能获取的成果
will take years and millions of dollars

277
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,016
在三个月内就被收获了 开销大概在三万和四五万美元之间
happened in 3 months in something around $30,000 to $40,000, $50,000.

278
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:38,135
你也许已经猜到了
You might have already guessed,

279
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:42,550
这样的变化需要 NASA 内部的文化作出改变
this kind of change required some culture shifts over at NASA.

280
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,750
他们中的有些人选择邀请外来的解决方案提供者
So, some of them invited those external solvers

281
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,325
进入项目组
to come to their organizations,

282
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:52,750
还有一些选择提供实习或合作机会
other created internships or collaboration,

283
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:55,848
他们采用了很多有意思的方法来交流知识
all types of interesting ways to bring that knowledge in,

284
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:57,848
使其不至于淤塞
and not to keep it kind of buffered.

285
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:02,281
仔细想想 这其实是很美好的
There's something kind of beautiful there when you think about it.

286
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,457
就如我们所知 很多组织仍然抵制开源开发
A lot of organizations still resist open source development

287
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:09,450
不愿放弃专有软件
and don't like giving up proprietary software,

288
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,400
但在这里 你可以找到这个星球上最具创新性
but here you've got the most innovative,

289
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,725
愿景宏大的一群科学家
biggest-picture group of scientists on the planet,

290
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,750
而他们说 嗨
and they're saying, yeah, you know what?

291
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,229
我们一起来
Let's do this together.

292
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,257
这样的态度有绝大的影响力
That's a powerful thing.

293
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,743
我们已经看到了开源给软件行业带来的变革
We've seen that revolution is software.

294
00:15:24,743 --> 00:15:28,239
我们目前尚未在科学与技术方面见到太多改变
We have not yet fully seen it in science and technology,

295
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,327
不过 我认为 现在就是最好的时机
and I think it is prime time to go through it.

296
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,926
计算物理学、计算生物学越是崛起
The more we see the rise of computational physics, computational biology,

297
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:38,428
这就越有可能实现
the more this will become possible.

298
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:41,189
我认为 大众还可以更多地参与到科研中
I think much more of the population

299
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:43,600
协助处理不同的任务
can participate and help in different type of tasks,

300
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,893
以这种方式
and maybe this way,

301
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:48,685
科学技术的发展速度或许甚至能够超过应用开发
science technology can really make progress beyond developing a new app.

302
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:56,995
Hila Lifshitz-Assaf 是纽约大学斯特恩商学院的教授
Hila Lifshitz-Assaf is a professor at the Stern School of business at NYU.

303
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:05,100
NASA 在开放他们的研究课题的道路上受益良多
NASA benefits massively from opening up their research challenges,

304
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,522
但他们同时也打造着另一种社区
but another way they build communities

305
00:16:07,522 --> 00:16:11,122
其中关键就在于“中小企业创新资助计划”
via the Small Business Innovation Grant program,

306
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,050
- 这个项目鼓励私营经济中的创新
which supports innovative work in the private sector.

307
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,268
所有大胆的项目都有风险 可能付出代价
All those blue sky projects that are risky
"Blue Sky Projects"：指看起来不切实际的大胆项目 字面译为“蓝天项目”

308
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:19,377
但有时回报也尤其丰厚
but might pay off big time.

309
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,375
大家好 我叫 Dan Wachspress
Hi, my name is Dan Wachspress.

310
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,375
我是一名航空工程师 在 Continuum Dynamics 集团工作
I'm an aeronautical engineer working at Continuum Dynamics Incorporated.

311
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:34,599
Dan 的公司专注于研究与开发旋翼飞行器
Dan's company, CDI, does R&D related to the rotorcraft industry.

312
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:37,700
也就是直升机、旋翼飞机这类
So that's helicopters, gyrocopters -

313
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,172
使用螺旋桨的飞行器
anything that uses wings or blades to fly,

314
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:43,364
一看就很“蓝天”
literally blue sky.

315
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:47,375
他们一直与 NASA 合作 致力于解决垂直起降的问题
They've been working with NASA researching vertical takeoff.

316
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,275
让飞行器能变得像是 Jetson 的“空中出租车”那样
Think Jetson-style air taxis.

317
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,515
总体的构思是
The whole idea is,

318
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:56,125
只要用电动机代替载具上的燃气轮机
once you have electric motors instead of gas turbine engines on your vehicles,

319
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,830
你就可以安装更多推进器
you can have many more propulsors.

320
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,744
它们会比现有的更安静、更安全
They could be much quieter, safer,

321
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:04,450
直升机所有恼人的问题统统消失
and all issues with helicopters that annoy people could go away,

322
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,750
而我们可能会得到这样的未来：
and we might have a world where

323
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:11,378
你打个的就能从达拉斯去到沃斯堡
you call up a taxi that takes you from Dallas to Fort Worth, let's say,

324
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:15,170
而那是一辆准乘 5 人、无人驾驶的电动飞的
in an electric-powered air taxi with 4 other passengers and no pilot,

325
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,560
而非一辆汽车 在汽车里面你还得跟堵车较劲
as opposed to getting in a car and trying to battle through the traffic.

326
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,023
这就是我们的愿景
That's the vision.

327
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,351
有很多公司 比如 Uber
A lot of companies, including Uber,

328
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,207
对这种空中出租车的设想非常感兴趣
are very interested in the potential of air taxis.

329
00:17:28,463 --> 00:17:31,425
而 NASA 在这之中扮演的角色是伟大的：
And the great thing about NASA's role here is that

330
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,425
它打破了不同公司本要各自为营死磕研究的壁垒
it breaks down barriers that would exist

331
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:38,375
它打破了不同公司本要各自为营死磕研究的壁垒
if each of those companies were slogging through the research on their own.

332
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:41,523
那些公司必定不想走漏风声
Companies do not want to divulge information necessarily.

333
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:45,975
他们想保持商业机密 不愿共享成果
They want to keep trade secrets, and they won't share knowledge.

334
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:47,700
NASA 的目标就是
NASA's goal is

335
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,925
把尽可能多的研究成果送到他们手里 让他们尽可能地获得能力
to put as much knowledge and have as much capability as possible

336
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:52,146
把尽可能多的研究成果送到他们手里 让他们尽可能地获得能力
out there in their hands.

337
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:55,718
而且我敢说你如果去问他们任何一家公司
And I think if you talk to any of these companies,

338
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:57,718
他们肯定会说
they'll agree that they're just,

339
00:17:58,225 --> 00:18:00,925
没有 NASA 长久以来的技术支持 他们没法做到这么快地开发
they wouldn't be able to do what they're doing as fast as they're doing

340
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:03,075
没有 NASA 长久以来的技术支持 他们没法做到这么快地开发
if they weren't supported by NASA

341
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:07,579
没有 NASA 长久以来的技术支持 他们没法做到这么快地开发
and the technology NASA is pushing on today and has pushed on in the past.

342
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,141
NASA 有一些非常棒的风洞 我看这总不能是坏事
I'm guessing it doesn't hurt that

343
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:18,421
NASA 有一些非常棒的风洞 我看这总不能是坏事
that NASA has already got some pretty killer wind tunnels, too.

344
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,490
从火星漫游车到飞行汽车
From Mars Rovers to flying cars,

345
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,607
你有感觉了吗？
are you getting a certain vibe here?

346
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:29,575
我们谈论的是创新 天穹尚且不是我们的极限
We're talking about innovation, where the sky is not even the limit.

347
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,825
而且这一切都归功于我们全地球级别的合作
And it's all because of the planet-sized collaboration

348
00:18:34,017 --> 00:18:36,876
而正是开源观念让这一切成为可能
that the open source mindset makes possible.

349
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,866
我们再回来和 NASA 的 Tom Soderstrom 聊聊
I promise we'd come back to NASA's Tom Soderstrom.

350
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:48,075
Tom 认为 我们两季以来探讨的开源的“魔力”
Tom figures that all the open source magic

351
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:50,651
Tom 认为 我们两季以来探讨的开源的“魔力”
we've been exploring for the past 2 seasons

352
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:53,931
已经形成了一股巨大的推动力
is building up into a massive shift point

353
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,825
他称之为第四次工业革命
that he calls the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

354
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,625
创新总是与科技的潮流挂钩
When you look at how innovation happens,

355
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,850
创新总是与科技的潮流挂钩
it's really about technology waves.

356
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,018
当今 有好几波科技浪潮同时袭来
And there's a lot of technology waves that are coming right now,

357
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,694
它们的合流将引起巨大的海啸
and they're all building to a giant tsunami.

358
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:13,499
它们逼近得越来越快
They're coming faster and faster,

359
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:17,419
所有事物都会为之改变
and they're all going to change everything,

360
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,774
因此 我称其为第四次工业革命
so that's why we call it the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

361
00:19:21,478 --> 00:19:24,886
我将简单几句带过那些浪潮
I'm just going to break down what's in those waves super fast,

362
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:28,684
虽然就它们中的每一样都可以独立讲一期节目
even though each one of them could be an episode in itself.

363
00:19:29,004 --> 00:19:31,925
Tom 所说的“即将到冲击我们生活的潮流”
When Tom talks about those waves that are hitting us,

364
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,389
包括了大规模的网络安全问题
he's talking about things like cybersecurity challenges at scale,

365
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:40,245
量子计算之类 也包括了各类“软件定义的”东西
quantum computing, and software-defined everything.

366
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:42,405
但这些只是其中的一小部分
But wait, there's more.

367
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:45,483
他还提到了普适计算、
He's also talking about ubiquitous computing,

368
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,736
自然用户界面 和物联网
natural interfaces, and the internet of things.

369
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:51,225
这些技术都将是那场海啸的一部分
These all build to the giant tsunami,

370
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:53,441
生活将因为无处不在的内置智能而大为改观
which is built-in intelligence everywhere.

371
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:57,025
想象一下海啸发生的样子
When you imagine this tsunami,

372
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:58,977
如果这些技术合流
this moment when it all comes together

373
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:01,375
产生了 1+1 大于 2 的效应
and creates something bigger than its individual parts,

374
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:03,954
那会带来什么？
what does that look like?

375
00:20:04,658 --> 00:20:06,776
我不认为这种变化会是突然发生的
I think it's not gonna be like one day somebody stands up and says, "look at this."

376
00:20:06,776 --> 00:20:09,875
不会有像是一个人站起来感叹“你看这个”
I think it's not gonna be like one day somebody stands up and says, "look at this."

377
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,618
“我现在宣布内置智能无处不在”这样的情况
"I am now announcing built-in intelligence everywhere."

378
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:15,125
它会逐渐渗透进生活的各个方面
It's creeping into everything that we do.

379
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,150
“智能” 对吧？
We say smart, right?

380
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,717
比如智能电视 或者智能会议室
The smart TV, a smart conference room.

381
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:23,850
我们会发现生活中的事物
That's really where we will start realizing

382
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,049
变得越来越智能 越来越聪明
that it's becoming smarter and smarter and smarter,

383
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:30,815
对于企业来说 它意味着 你可以对着一个房间提出问题
and for the enterprise it means you can just ask a question by speaking to the room

384
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:33,875
然后程序会为你在好几 PB 的数据里
and it searches through petabytes of data

385
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:38,425
从几千种数据源里找出答案
in thousands of different data sources and gets you the answer.

386
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:40,875
而这背后 就是自然语言处理、
So it's natural language processing.

387
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,550
深度学习、机器学习这样的技术
It's deep learning, it's machine learning,

388
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,510
而我们不会突然说 “哇 我们已经发展到这种地步了”
and we're not gonna say all of a sudden, wow we're here.

389
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,726
不会的 这是一个循序渐进、潜移默化的过程
It's just going keep morphing and getting better and better.

390
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:52,273
这第四次工业革命
Thinking about this Fourth Industrial Revolution,

391
00:20:52,273 --> 00:20:56,833
又会如何影响你在 JPL 的工作呢？
how does that influence the way you do work at the Jet Propulsion Lab?

392
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,150
我认为首先是实验
I think the experimentation,

393
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:04,450
下一场工业革命可以帮助我们更快地完成实验
this next industrial revolution is really helping us experiment quicker

394
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:08,077
并且利用更好的组件
and to take advantage of much better components,

395
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:09,403
包括软件和硬件
both software and hardware,

396
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,700
也许我们不需要把所有的东西都造出来
that perhaps we don't have to build all of it,

397
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,113
但是我们可以更智能地使用它
but we can just be more intelligent about using it.

398
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,005
然后是开源
And then open source.

399
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:22,782
开源真是一项颠覆我们工作方式和工作内容的事业
Open source is really what's changing a lot of how we work and what we do.

400
00:21:22,974 --> 00:21:24,290
此话怎讲？
How so? Tell me more about that.

401
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:29,618
说到开源这东西 我的资历足够老 我当年也经历过开源战争
I think the open source, I'm old enough to have gone through the open source wars,

402
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,750
当时开源还只是玩具
where the open source was a toy.

403
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,182
那时的开源很糟糕 开源软件似乎比商业软件低一等似的
It was bad, it was inferior to commercial.

404
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,716
不过 那些都已经是过去了
All of that has kind of gone away,

405
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,985
至少在喷气动力实验室是这样的
at least at JPL.

406
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:44,925
现在 开源的方式更适合我们
Now it's what's most appropriate for the problem at hand.

407
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,679
开源的研究与开发更加经济划算
It's more economical.

408
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:48,593
也可以更快地做实验验证
It's much faster to experiment.

409
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:50,925
另外 因为开源软件的存在
Another one is in open sources,

410
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:53,163
现在我们再也不用全部从头造轮子了
we don't have to develop everything ourselves anymore.

411
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:57,979
我们可以自己开发 在此之后 如果我们选择将之开源
We can develop it, and then if we can release it open source,

412
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,250
就能从社区获得帮助 对成果进行改进
we can get help to make it better.

413
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:03,875
开源的软件和科研也能为我们招贤纳士
And then it helps us retain and attract talent.

414
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,100
这就很有趣了
This one is interesting.

415
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,661
确实很有意思
Oh, that is interesting.

416
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,126
我认为现在的人们 特别是新一代
I think people, the new generation especially,

417
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:16,969
可以将他们的项目开源 以此获得更大影响力 得到尽可能多的星标
get their street creds from submitting to open source and getting as many stars as possible.

418
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,538
你可以看见他们的简历上写着
So that's what you'll see on the resume.

419
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:20,538
我开发的软件得到了多少星标
My software got x stars.

420
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:22,335
有一点让我很感兴趣：
What's really interesting about

421
00:22:22,335 --> 00:22:28,003
让你们的工作方式和内容发生变化的开源
how much open source has affected and helped the work that you're doing

422
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:30,676
并不是什么新鲜事物 对吧？
is the fact that open source isn't new, right?

423
00:22:30,676 --> 00:22:34,725
你说你经历过开源战争
You mentioned yourself that you've lived through the open source wars.

424
00:22:34,725 --> 00:22:36,725
你也见证了开源在这么多年来的发展
You've seen it progress over the years.

425
00:22:36,725 --> 00:22:40,168
那么 当今的开源
What is it about open source today

426
00:22:40,488 --> 00:22:43,256
有哪些优势是十年、十五年、二十年前没有的呢？
that allows you to really take advantage of it

427
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:47,025
有哪些优势是十年、十五年、二十年前没有的呢？
in a way that maybe you couldn't 10, 15, 20 years ago?

428
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:48,175
有好几点
There's a couple.

429
00:22:48,175 --> 00:22:50,879
一个就是云计算
One of them is simply cloud computing.

430
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:53,001
我们不用压上很多钱
We don't have to do the big bet

431
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:58,025
购买一堆软件然后使用许多年
and buy a bunch of software and own it for many years.

432
00:22:58,345 --> 00:22:59,415
我们可以在云端简单地做个实验
We can just experiment.

433
00:22:59,415 --> 00:23:00,568
这点相当重要
So that's been a big one.

434
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:02,824
还有另外一点
The other one is the realization that

435
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,384
就是开源并不比闭源的安全性差
open source is no less secure than commercial source.

436
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,975
这早就不是
It's no longer,

437
00:23:08,975 --> 00:23:11,399
- 请原谅我的用词 - 一个信仰的问题了
forgive the expression, a religious argument.

438
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:14,879
这更多地只是一个实用性和经济性的问题
It's just more of an economical and practical discussion.

439
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:18,875
开源显然在你的工作当中扮演了一个重要的角色
Open source has clearly played a big part in what you all are doing,

440
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:22,675
尤其是当你谈及喷气动力实验室的未来
especially when you think about the future of JPL

441
00:23:22,675 --> 00:23:24,351
以及你期望它以怎样的方式前行的时候
and what you hope to accomplish moving forward.

442
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:29,166
开源似乎仍将是故事的重要组成部分
It sounds like open source will probably continue to be a big part of that story.

443
00:23:29,422 --> 00:23:33,831
你认为在最理想的情况下 能够导向怎么样的成果
When you think about the most exciting or the most ideal outcome

444
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:36,420
如果要采取开源社区式的合作开发的话？
of that collaboration, that participation,

445
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:42,086
而对于人类 它的意义又是什么？
what might that look like and what do you think it will mean for humankind?

446
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,746
好问题
That's a great question.

447
00:23:43,746 --> 00:23:49,330
我认为你刚刚已经说出了正确答案 - - “人类”
I think that the real answer is you just said it, humankind.

448
00:23:49,714 --> 00:23:53,378
它的理想结果是能让每个人都参与到这份工作中来 它的意义也在此
it's getting everybody more involved in what we do.

449
00:23:53,762 --> 00:23:56,775
你知道 总有一天我们会把人送上火星
You know, one day we're going to put humans on Mars.

450
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:01,271
我们要探索更广袤的深空 去寻找地球 2.0
We're going to explore even further to find Earth 2.0.

451
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:06,030
我们还要再开展一次载人登月
We're going to put humans on the moon again.

452
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:10,879
这些都需要来自世界各地的人们积极参与
All of that will require a lot more involvement from the world.

453
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,237
我被这场变革深深的吸引了
I'm into that revolution.

454
00:24:16,813 --> 00:24:21,565
Tom Soderstrom 是 NASA 喷气动力实验室的首席技术与创新官
Tom Soderstrom is the chief technology and innovation officer for IT

455
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:24,205
Tom Soderstrom 是 NASA 喷气动力实验室的首席技术与创新官
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

456
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:32,283
从地球 2.0 的话题 回到地球 1.0
From Earth 2.0, back to Earth 1.0.

457
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:37,853
我们应当铭记 “第四次工业革命”的起源 也是艰苦朴素的
It's time to remember the humble origins of that Fourth Industrial Revolution.

458
00:24:38,237 --> 00:24:40,926
开源项目固然可以变得宏大无比 但千里之行毕竟始于足下
As grand as open source projects can get,

459
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:46,362
伟大事业的伊始 或许只是几名极客试图让漫游车正常工作
it all starts with a group of hackers just trying to make their rover work.

460
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,214
我们再看看这样它能不能跑起来
So we're gonna see if it'll run.

461
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:52,942
我们会 - 再加一样东西 方便它从坎上过去
We're gonna, we put down another thing to help it get over the curb.

462
00:24:57,775 --> 00:24:59,590
过去了！好耶！
It made it. Yay!

463
00:24:59,974 --> 00:25:01,138
好耶
Yay!

464
00:25:02,153 --> 00:25:02,603
唉呀
Uh-oh.

465
00:25:03,525 --> 00:25:04,623
我下不来了
Now I can't get down.

466
00:25:04,623 --> 00:25:05,879
它被卡在花坛里了
It's stuck in the flower bed.

467
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:15,460
我们把它抬出来就行了
We're just going to have to lift it out.

468
00:25:16,425 --> 00:25:18,590
这又不是在火星 你可以直接走过去 把它拿起来
It's not on Mars. You can just go over and pick it up.

469
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,180
我觉得他们有所进步
I think they're making progress.

470
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:29,671
让我们和这些代码英雄说再见吧
We're going to leave those command line heroes just the way we found them,

471
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,308
他们要继续学习、探索、投入他们的工作了
exploring, learning, diving into their work,

472
00:25:33,308 --> 00:25:38,479
他们会知道 通过开源 我们总有一天可以到达天空之外的高度
and knowing that, through open source, the sky's not even the limit.

473
00:25:40,492 --> 00:25:43,754
如果你想升级自己的开源水平
If you're ready to level up your own open source game,

474
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:48,064
不要忘了我们正在开发《代码英雄》游戏
don't forget, we've been building Command Line Heroes: The Game,

475
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,700
开发已经持续了一整季的时间 现在你仍然可以贡献代码
all season long and you can still contribute.

476
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,701
嗨 我是 Michael
Hi, I'm Michael.

477
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:53,768
嗨 我是 Jared
Hi, I'm Jared.

478
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:57,096
我们是《代码英雄》游戏的开发人员
And we're the developers of Command Line Heroes: The Game.

479
00:25:58,175 --> 00:26:01,718
我们请来了红帽的 Jared Sprague 和 Michael Clayton
We checked in with Jared Sprague and Michael Clayton from Red Hat

480
00:26:01,718 --> 00:26:03,575
看看情况怎么样
to find out how it's going.

481
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:09,164
我有点惊讶于我们这么快就引来了这么多的感兴趣的人
I was a little surprised at how much interest we got so quickly.

482
00:26:09,164 --> 00:26:15,580
反响非常好 提交的拉取请求蹭蹭上涨
The response was just phenomenal, and the pull requests started flowing.

483
00:26:15,772 --> 00:26:18,893
你认为是什么让大家这么激动？
What do you think it is that got people so excited?

484
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:23,281
我认为我们播客的许多听众都受到了鼓励
I think this just was for a lot of people listening to the podcast,

485
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,881
因此他们看到这个开源项目就迫不及待地想试试看
kind of a catalyst for them to try it out,

486
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:31,889
尤其是自从我们开始征求不限类型的贡献
especially since we put out a call for all types of contributions,

487
00:26:32,017 --> 00:26:35,525
让任何想要贡献的创意人员、
any type of creative person that wants to contribute or

488
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,551
任何类型的工程师都能够参与项目后
an engineer of any type,

489
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:39,346
听众就找到事儿做了
there's something that they can do on it.

490
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:43,100
那么你接下来希望社区能给大家带来什么？
So what do you hope to see next from the community?

491
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,508
这游戏还在开发中 你最想见到什么?
The game is still in development. What do you hope to see?

492
00:26:46,828 --> 00:26:53,050
我个人非常享受开发过程中的进入节奏的感觉
I would personally really like to get into the groove of development,

493
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:59,082
我们让大家贡献美术素材 音乐 音效
where we have people contributing art assets and music and sound effects,

494
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:04,282
故事线 代码 所有这些东西都可以并行不悖
storyline, coding, and all of these things can all work in parallel,

495
00:27:04,538 --> 00:27:07,927
一旦每个人都进入节奏
and once we get everyone into that groove,

496
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:11,315
我们可以一起开发 共同看着游戏被开发出来
and we're all just building a game and we can see it coming together,

497
00:27:11,443 --> 00:27:12,980
那真是太美妙了
that's going to be a great time.

498
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:17,659
顺带一提 我们的游戏的公测版将会在五月七日到九日
By the way, we'll have a beta of the game on display
原播客于2018年上线

499
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:20,363
在波士顿开办的红帽峰会发布
at this year's Red Hat Summit - in Boston,

500
00:27:20,683 --> 00:27:24,731

Check out the details at redhat.com/summit.

503
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:36,133
最后一件事
And one final announcement.

504
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:40,362
这或许是第二季的最终章 但这不是真正的告别
This may be the end of season 2, but it's not really goodbye.

505
00:27:40,653 --> 00:27:43,165
第三季已经在制作中！
Season 3 is already in the works!

506
00:27:43,506 --> 00:27:48,091
与此同时 我们也会为大家带来一期番外
And in the meantime, we've got a bonus episode coming your way.

507
00:27:48,386 --> 00:27:52,178
我们开展了一次圆桌会议
We're hosting a roundtable with some of our favorite thinkers -

508
00:27:52,478 --> 00:27:55,182
与你们最喜爱的思想家们探讨开源的未来
