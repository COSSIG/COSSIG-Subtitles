1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,176
1991 年 6 月 26 日
On June the 26th, 1991,

2
00:00:03,176 --> 00:00:05,950
在华盛顿特区 马里兰州和西弗吉尼亚州的大部分地区
Washington DC, much of Maryland and West Virginia,

3
00:00:06,078 --> 00:00:11,975
我祖国的许多地区都因公共电话网络的大规模故障而瘫痪了
major portions of my home state were paralyzed by massive failure in the public telephone network.

4
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:17,175
然而 随着技术变得越来越复杂 网络系统越来越相互依存
And yet, as technology becomes more sophisticated and network systems more interdependent,

5
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:19,751
反复发生故障的可能性也会增加
the likelihood of recurrent failures increases.

6
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:22,675
这种状况的发生 是之前就警告过的
It's not as though there wasn't warning that this would happen.

7
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:25,675
在 20 世纪 90 年代初
In the early 1990s,

8
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:31,357
有 1200 万美国人遭受了大规模的电话网络故障
12 million Americans were hit with massive phone network failures.

9
00:00:31,357 --> 00:00:33,054
人们不能给医院打电话
People couldn't call the hospital.

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,250
企业不能给客户打电话
Businesses couldn't call customers.

11
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,938
父母不能打电话给托儿所
Parents couldn't call their daycares.

12
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:42,946
对于一个基础设施严重依赖于万物互联的计算机系统的国家来说
It was chaos and it was also a serious wake-up call,

13
00:00:42,946 --> 00:00:46,847
对于一个基础设施严重依赖于万物互联的计算机系统的国家来说
a wake-up call for a country whose infrastructure relied heavily

14
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:50,300
这是一场混乱 也是一声警钟
on the computer systems that networked everything.

15
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:54,275
这些计算机网络变得越来越大
Those computer networks were growing larger and larger,

16
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:56,851
然后当它们出现故障时
and then when they failed,

17
00:00:58,214 --> 00:01:00,466
故障的后果就会极为严重
yeah, they failed big time.

18
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:04,617
电脑故障会导致电话系统崩溃
A computer failure caused that phone system crash.

19
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:12,850
在今天 代码中的一行小错误的后果比以往时候都要严重
This tiny one line bug in the code, and today the consequences of little bugs like that are higher than ever.

20
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,475
我是 Saron Yitbarek
I'm Saron Yitbarek

21
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:20,469
这里是是红帽公司的原创播客节目《代码英雄》
and this is Command Line Heroes, an original podcast from Red Hat.

22
00:01:23,898 --> 00:01:28,458
因此 软件安全性和可靠性比以往任何时候都重要
So software security and reliability matter more than ever.

23
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:34,223
传统的瀑布式开发方法中 安全性只是一个附加流程而已
The old waterfall approach to development, where security was just tacked onto the end of things,

24
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:36,314
这样的方式已经不再适用
that doesn't cut it anymore.

25
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,772
我们生活在一个 DevOps 的世界里
We're living in a DevOps world

26
00:01:38,772 --> 00:01:42,813
一切都变得更快、更敏捷、扩展性更强
where everything is faster, more agile, and scalable

27
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:47,396
这在电话网络崩溃时是人们无法想象的
in ways they couldn't even imagine back when that phone network crashed.

28
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:53,958
这意味着我们的安全和可靠性标准必须不断改进 以应对这些挑战
That means our security and reliability standards have to evolve to meet those challenges.

29
00:01:55,706 --> 00:02:00,906
在本集中 我们将研究如何将安全工作集成到 DevOps 中
In this episode, we're going to figure out how to integrate security into DevOps,

30
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:07,539
我们还将探索提升运营可靠性和弹性的新方法
and we're also exploring new approaches to building reliability and resilience into operations.

31
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:14,721
在介绍了所有这些之后 我们还有很多东西可以讨论
Even after covering all that, we know there's so much more we could talk about

32
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,394
因为在 DevSecOps 的世界里
because in a DevSecOps world,

33
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:22,132
不管对于开发人员 还是运营人员 现状都在快速变化
things are changing fast for both the developers and operations.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,925
从不同的立场上来看 这些变化的意义也随之改变
These changes mean different things depending on where you're standing,

35
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:27,150
但这是我们的看法
but this is our take.

36
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,875
我们也很想听到你们的观点
We'd love to hear yours too -

37
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:33,230
如果你认为我们错过了什么 不要害羞 - 在网上联系我们
so don't be shy if you think we've missed something - hit us up online.

38
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:38,976
好了 让我们开始探索这个全新的领域吧
All right, let's dig in and start exploring this brand new territory.

39
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:47,487
事情就是这样 想让安全性和可靠性跟上时代的步伐
Here's the thing, getting security and reliability up to speed,

40
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:49,879
并为 DevOps 世界做好准备
getting it ready for a DevOps world,

41
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:54,123
我们就必须对工作方式进行一些关键的调整
means we have to make a couple of key adjustments to the way we work.

42
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:58,235
第一 我们必须拥抱自动化
Number one, we have to embrace automation.

43
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:02,825
我是说 想想如果要人为实行两步验证 对后勤的负担会多么庞大
I mean, think about the logistics of say two-factor authentication.

44
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:06,489
想想那些难以想象的艰巨任务吧
Think of the impossibly huge task that poses.

45
00:03:06,832 --> 00:03:11,221
很显然 你不能仅仅通过增加员工来解决问题
It's pretty obvious you're not going to solve things by just adding more staff,

46
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:14,373
所以第一点就是拥抱自动化
so that's number one, embracing automation.

47
00:03:14,757 --> 00:03:18,799
然后 第二点 这个可能不是那么明显
And then, number two, and this one's maybe less obvious,

48
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:24,103
那就是真正地去改变文化 使安全从业者不再受人回避
it's really changing the culture so security isn't a boogeyman anymore.

49
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:27,731
稍后我将解释我所说的改变文化的含义
I'm going to explain what I mean by changing the culture later on,

50
00:03:27,987 --> 00:03:31,395
但是 让我们分别解释这两点
but let's tackle these two steps one at a time.

51
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,123
首先 拥抱自动化
First up, embracing automation.

52
00:03:41,877 --> 00:03:49,957
以前 应用程序的部署在每次发布之前 都需要人为的安全审查
Once upon a time app deployment involved a human-driven security review before every single release,

53
00:03:50,432 --> 00:03:54,416
而你多半也注意到了 - 人为审查可能会有亿点慢
and I don't know if you've noticed, but humans, they can be a little slow.

54
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:57,350
因此 如果要将安全工作整合进 DevOps
That's why automation is such a key part

55
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,792
自动化必然是其中不可或缺的一环
of building security into DevOps.

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,352
以 Verizon 最近的数据泄露报告为例
Take, for example, this recent data breach report from Verizon.

57
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:11,776
他们发现 81% 的黑客入侵涉及密码被盗或者弱密码
They found that 81% of all hacking–related breaches involve stolen or weak passwords,

58
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:15,360
从表面上看 这是一个非常简单的问题
and that's on the face of it such a simple problem.

59
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,152
但问题的规模却很大
But it's a simple problem at a huge scale.

60
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:20,937
就像我之前说的
Like I mentioned before,

61
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:25,376
你不能靠增加人手解决 3000 万个密码问题 对吧？
you're not going to staff your way out of 30 million password issues, right?

62
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:30,896
问题在于解决大规模问题
The hurdle is addressing that problem of scale, the huge size of it,

63
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:36,559
而每次的答案都是一样的 那就是自动化 自动化
and the answer is the same every time. It's automation, automation.

64
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:40,799
如果你总等着人参与进来 那么服务的规模就不会扩大
If you wait for a human being to get involved, it's not going to scale.

65
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:45,120
Vincent Danen 是红帽公司产品安全部门的主管
Vincent Danen is the director of product security at Red Hat

66
00:04:45,248 --> 00:04:52,441
在过去的 20 年里 他见证了 DevOps 的快速发展
and over the 20 years he's been at this, he's watched as DevOps created a faster and faster environment.

67
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,375
安全团队不得不努力追赶
Security teams have had to race to keep up.

68
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:59,597
刚开始的时候 每个月都有漏洞
When I started, it was a vulnerability per month

69
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:03,026
后来变成了隔周一次 然后是每周都有
and then it started becoming every other week and then every week,

70
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:07,753
现在 每天都能找到几百个漏洞
and now we're into the, you know, literally finding hundreds of these things every day.

71
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:11,229
有趣的是 正如 Vincent 所说
What's interesting here is that Vincent says

72
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:16,998
随着安全团队的进步 漏洞会越来越多 而不是越来越少
there are actually more vulnerabilities showing up as security teams evolve, not less.

73
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:21,927
我们永远不会说 哦 我们现在安全了 我们做完了 我们的工作结束了
We'll never get to the point where we say, oh, we're secure now, we're done. Our job is over.

74
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:25,982
安全工作会一直存在 就像呼吸一样 这是必须要有的
It'll always be there. It's just something that has to be as normal as breathing now.

75
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:35,150
事实证明 对于安全性和可靠性团队来说 细节的问题变得越来越重要
It turns out what counts as an issue for security and reliability teams is becoming more and more nuanced.

76
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:38,100
只要我们还在寻找这些漏洞 我们就会发现更多
As we're looking for these things, we're finding more

77
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,446
而且这个趋势还将继续 因为你会发现新的漏洞类型
and this trend is going to continue as you find new classes of vulnerabilities

78
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:45,245
以及以前不受重视的因素
and things we maybe didn't think were important or

79
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,717
甚至是在此前未知的因素
didn't even know they existed before.

80
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,444
我们发现漏洞的速度更快了 它们的数量也变得更多
We're finding out about these things much faster and there's more of them.

81
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,845
因此工作的规模爆炸性增长
And so the scale kind of explodes.

82
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:59,136
新知识、软件的体量、消费者的数量
It's knowledge. It's volume of software. It's number of consumers.

83
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:05,850
都促进了安全领域的进步以及漏洞的增加
All of these things contribute to the growth of security in this area and the vulnerabilities that we're finding.

84
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,650
一旦你将安全视为一个不断发展的问题
Once you see security as an evolving issue

85
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,425
而不是随着时间的推移而 “得到解决”的问题
rather than one that gets "solved" over time,

86
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:17,650
那么自动化的理由就会变得更加充分
the case for automation, well, it gets even stronger.

87
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,775
嗯 我认为有了自动化
Well, I think with automation

88
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:25,942
你可以很快将新的流程集成到你的开发流水线中
you can integrate this stuff into your development pipelines in a way that is very fast, for one.

89
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,060
其二 你不需要人类来做这些工作 对吧？
For two, you don't require human beings to do this effort, right?

90
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,518
计算机不需要睡觉
Computers don't need to sleep,

91
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:35,926
所以你可以在处理器允许的情况下以最快速度审查代码
so you can churn through code as fast as your processors will allow

92
00:06:35,926 --> 00:06:42,279
而不是人为查看某些可能相当冗长乏味的内容
rather than waiting for a human to pour through some maybe rather tedious lines of code

93
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,981
来查找漏洞
to go looking for vulnerabilities.

94
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:46,062
通过模式匹配和启发式方法
And then with pattern-matching and heuristics,

95
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:51,300
在开始编写代码的时候 你就可以知道代码中那些地方是易受攻击的
you can actually determine what's vulnerable even at the time of writing the code to begin with.

96
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,836
如果在你编写代码的时候
So if you have, like, a plug-in, you know,

97
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:57,780
在你的 IDE 或者工具中有一个插件
for your IDE or your tool that you're using to write your code,

98
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,125
它能告诉你 嘿 这看起来有点可疑
it can tell you as you're writing it, like, hey, maybe this looks a little fishy,

99
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,750
或者你刚刚引入了一个漏洞
or you've just introduced a vulnerability

100
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,838
在你提交代码之前你都可以纠正这些疑点或者漏洞
and you can correct these things before you even commit the code.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,779
写代码时就能做安全检查 这是一大红利
Security on the move. That's a huge bonus.

102
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,050
每一天 甚至每一小时 都会有新的开发任务被完成
There's just so much that's coming out every, every day, every hour even.

103
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,058
通过持续集成和持续部署
With continuous integration and continuous delivery,

104
00:07:20,058 --> 00:07:22,700
你写了代码 10 分钟后它就被部署了
you write code and it's deployed 10 minutes later.

105
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:30,900
因此 在代码被推送之前自动进行验证是很有必要的
so it's really critical to get that validation of that code automatically prior to it being pushed out.

106
00:07:32,225 --> 00:07:36,401
我们可以使用各种各样的工具来完成这个任务
A whole breadth of tools are available so we can actually get this done,

107
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:43,265
不管是静态代码分析 还是 IDE 的插件 或者别的什么选项
whether it's static code analysis or plug-ins for your IDE or a whole bunch of other options.

108
00:07:43,265 --> 00:07:46,561
我们将在 redhat.com/commandlineheroes 上
We'll share some of our favorites in the show notes for this episode

109
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:50,897
分享一些我们最喜欢的工具
over at redhat.com/commandlineheroes.

110
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:57,585
一旦我们有了这些工具 它们将帮助我们把安全放在首位
Once we've got those tools in place, they help keep security top of mind.

111
00:07:57,585 --> 00:08:03,233
结果就是 DevOps 被重新定义为 DevSecOps
The result, DevOps gets re-imagined as DevSecOps.

112
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:06,375
安全被纳入到流程中
Security gets baked into the process.

113
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:12,611
就像开发人员和运维人员结合的方式一样
In the same way that developers and operations kind of combined,

114
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:16,041
你将这两个领域合成到了一个领域
you took those two disciplines to generate one.

115
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,157
现在 你有了 DevOps
Now you have DevOps,

116
00:08:17,157 --> 00:08:22,800
并将安全这第三个组件与开发和运维集成到一起
and taking that third component of security and integrating that in with development and operations,

117
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,525
我认为这非常重要
I think is really important because

118
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:30,560
如果出事后才考虑安全性 安全工作会变得极为被动 极为昂贵
having security as the afterthought is what makes security so reactive, so expensive,

119
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,696
也可能损害消费者的利益
so damaging or potentially damaging to consumers.

120
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:36,117
如果你一开始就把安全代入其中
And when you plug that in right at the beginning,

121
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:41,829
完成开发任务之后 从头到尾进行安全检查 背后就是运维的工作
you have development being done, securities in there from start to finish and the operations work.

122
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:47,150
当然 就像我们在这一集的开头提到的
Of course, like we mentioned at the top of the episode,

123
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:52,798
自动化只是图景的一半 而 Vincent 也明白这一点
automation is really just one half of a bigger pie and Vincent gets that.

124
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,825
自动化之外还有其他部分
It's not just one piece.

125
00:08:54,825 --> 00:09:00,566
不能仅仅在你的 CI/CD 流水线中随便引入一个工具就期望一切都变好
You can't just, you know, throw a tool in your CI/CD pipeline and expect everything to be okay.
CI/CD：指“持续集成、持续交付、持续部署”
是一种工业化的软件开发流程 通过大量的自动化 让服务能被快速更改、快速上线

126
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:08,366
为了达到我们希望看到的最终有益结果
There's a whole gamut of different techniques and technologies and behaviors

127
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:14,190
需要使用各种技术和行为
that are required to produce those ultimate beneficial results that we want to see.

128
00:09:14,894 --> 00:09:17,215
自动化确实让我们做到了一半
Automation does get us partway there,

129
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:21,583
但我们必须记住另一部分 - 稍微模糊一点的那一部分
but we've got to remember the other piece - that slightly fuzzier piece.

130
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,921
跟我一起说：那就是文化部分
Say it with me, the culture piece,

131
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:28,083
让开发者和运维人员都一起参与进来
getting developers and ops both on board

132
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,889
这样这些问题就不再是可怕的问题
so that these issues aren't boogeyman anymore.

133
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:35,315
我们必须改变文化
We have to change a culture

134
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:40,259
而有些人正在以一种最不痛苦的方式来做到这一点：
and some folks are learning to do that in the least painful way possible,

135
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,375
通过游戏
with games.

136
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,628
现在让我们来看看运维的那一面
Let's take a swing over to the op side of things now.

137
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:52,107
如今建立庞大的基础设施很容易
It's so easy to stand up huge infrastructure these days,

138
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:55,498
但这并不意味着我们应该做粗制滥造的工作
but that doesn't mean we should be doing shoddy work.

139
00:09:55,725 --> 00:10:00,080
我们仍然应该努力改进我们的系统 确保可靠性
We should still be hammering on our systems, ensuring reliability,

140
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,024
未雨绸缪
figuring out how to prepare for the unexpected.

141
00:10:03,575 --> 00:10:06,983
这就是 Jesse Robbins 正在努力实现的
That's the mindset Jesse Robbins is working to bring about.

142
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:11,671
如今 Jesse 是 Orion Labs 的 CEO
Today Jesse is the CEO of Orion Labs,

143
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:17,447
但在此之前 他在亚马逊是著名的“灾难大师”
but before that he was known as the master of disaster over at Amazon.

144
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,250
在那里 Jesse 发挥他的才智
During his time there, Jesse was pretty much a wizard

145
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,508
让大家对问题至少有了了解
at getting everybody at least aware of these issues.

146
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:24,950
他通过一个叫做 “游戏日” 的活动来做到这一点

147
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,654
他通过一个叫做 “游戏日” 的活动来做到这一点
And he did it with something called Game Day.

148
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,110
这些活动有时会让成千上万的员工参与故障演练
These can involve thousands of employees running through disaster scenario drills,

149
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,829
通过灾难演练来习惯系统失灵的状况
getting used to the idea of things breaking

150
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:38,700
并了解其发生的原因和方式
and getting intimate with the why and the how.

151
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:41,707
下面是 Jesse 和我的讨论
Here's Jesse and me talking it over,

152
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:47,403
话题是提升运营可靠性和弹性的方式
looking especially at how reliability and resilience get built into the operation side.

153
00:10:48,475 --> 00:10:53,006
大家都知道你做了很多非常酷的事情
Okay, so you are known for many things, and one of those things is

154
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:55,582
其中之一就是你在亚马逊做的活动 - “游戏日”
the exercise "Game Day",

155
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:56,032
那是什么?
what you did at Amazon. What is that, what's Game Day?
Yeah

156
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:58,414
那是什么?
what you did at Amazon. What is that, what's Game Day?

157
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:02,289
“游戏日” 是我创建的一个项目
So Game Day was a program that I created

158
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:09,275
它通过大规模破坏来测试最脆弱系统的运行情况
to test the operational readiness of the most vulnerable systems

159
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:11,581
它通过大规模破坏来测试最脆弱系统的运行情况
by breaking things at massive scale.

160
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:17,597
如果你是 Netflix 的 “混沌猴子” 的粉丝
So if you're a fan of what's called Chaos Monkey Now by the Netflix people and others,

161
00:11:17,597 --> 00:11:21,837
“游戏日” 则是我创造的这一项目的后继者
Game Day was the name for my program that definitely proceeded all of that.

162
00:11:22,006 --> 00:11:27,777
实际上 它非常专注于建立一种卓越的运营文化
It was really heavily focused on building a culture of operational excellence,

163
00:11:27,777 --> 00:11:33,409
建立大规模测试系统的能力
building the capability to test systems at massive scale when they're breaking,

164
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,950
当系统崩溃时 能了解它们是如何崩溃的以改进它们
learn how they break to improve them.

165
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,416
然后还要建立一种文化
And then also to build a culture

166
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:46,000
能够对事件做出反应并恢复
that is capable of responding to and recovering from incidents in situations.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,350
它是按照事故指挥系统来设计的
And it was all modeled and is all modeled

168
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,487
它是按照事故指挥系统来设计的
after the incident command system,

169
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:55,375
这是世界各地的消防部门用来处理各种规模事故的系统
which is what the fire departments use around the world for dealing with incidents of any size.

170
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,082
它的诞生源于…
It was sort of born from ...

171
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:03,714
Jesse 早在 2005 年就经过训练成为一名消防员
Crazy side note, Jesse trained to be a firefighter back in 2005.

172
00:12:04,034 --> 00:12:07,297
在那儿 他了解了这个事故指挥系统
And that's where he learned this incident command system

173
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:09,426
最终激发了 “游戏日” 的灵感
that ended up inspiring Game Day.

174
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:14,124
因此 所有做这些故障演练的开发人员
So all the developers doing these disaster scenarios out there,

175
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:19,580
都要感谢 Jesse 对消防和应急管理的激情
you've got Jesse's passion for firefighting and emergency management to thank for that.

176
00:12:19,836 --> 00:12:21,475
好了 回到我们的谈话
Okay, back to our chat.

177
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,857
评估系统弹性时 应着眼于其整体的图景
Resilience is the ability of a system,

178
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:31,301
系统中包括人员 以及这些人为应对变化而作的准备
and that includes people and the things that those people build to adapt to change,

179
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:33,541
弹性是系统整体应对失败和干扰的能力
to respond to failures and disturbances.

180
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:36,693
而建立这种弹性的最佳方法之一
And one of the best ways to build that

181
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:40,455
即 建立一种文化 使人们能够对逆境做出反应
to build a culture that can respond to those types of environments

182
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:42,261
并真正理解这些环境如何运作的方法
and really understands how those work

183
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:44,525
就是提供人员培训演习
is to provide people training exercises.

184
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:49,341
这些演习可以很简单
And those exercises can be as simple as something like,

185
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:51,551
比如重启服务器
you know, rebooting a server

186
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:55,925
也可以很复杂 比如关闭整个数据中心
or as complicated as a injecting massive scale faults

187
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:58,450
以此造成大规模故障等等
by turning off entire datacenters

188
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,064
以及在两者之间的各种可能性
and kind of everything in between.

189
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:04,950
所以 “游戏日” 首先是一个过程
And so what a Game Day is is first of all a process

190
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,665
在这个过程中 你通过让整个组织聚集在一起
where you prepare for something by getting an entire organization together

191
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:12,225
讨论系统如何发生故障
and kind of talking about how systems fail

192
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:16,977
并思考人类对故障发生的预期
and thinking about what human beings know about how they expect failure to happen.

193
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:19,933
而这个演习本身
And that exercise by itself

194
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:23,955
常常是 “游戏日” 开始时最有价值的部分之一
is often one of the most valuable parts of kind of the beginning of a Game Day.

195
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:27,107
但是 当你实际对系统做了破坏后
But then you actually run an exercise where you break something.

196
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,107
这种破坏可大可小
It could be something big, it could be something small.

197
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:31,168
也有可能经常发生
It could be something that breaks all the time.

198
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:32,678
当你这样做的时候
And when you do that,

199
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:37,075
你就可以看到每个人是如何反应的
you're able to study how everyone responds where things can move to.

200
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:39,920
你看到系统崩溃了
You can see the system breaking

201
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,850
可能是崩溃了也没关系的组件
and that might be something that is safe to break,

202
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,890
可能是一个被充分理解的组件
a well-understood component

203
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,562
也可能这次崩溃暴露了一个潜在的缺陷
or it might be something that exposes what we call a latent defect.

204
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:56,088
这些问题隐藏在软件、技术或者大规模的系统中
Those are those problems hiding in software or in technology or in a system at scale

205
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:58,200
只有当你遇到极端或者意外事件时
that we only can find out about

206
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,044
我们才能发现
when you have an extreme or an unexpected event.

207
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:06,799
“游戏日” 的目的是为了训练员工并且建立系统
It's really designed to train people and to build systems that

208
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,463
并让你了解它们如何在压力下工作
you understand how they're going to work under stress and under strain.

209
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,892
所以当我听到 “游戏日” 的时候 我就会想
And so when I hear Game Day, it makes me think,

210
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:19,220
“这是对某个特定事件的回应吗?
“Was this a response to something very specific that happened, that inspired it?

211
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,116
它是从哪儿来的?”
Where'd it come from?”

212
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:23,612
“游戏日” 刚开始的一段时间内
So Game Day started during a period of time

213
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:27,664
因为我知道自己的角色
where I knew because of my role and because of my unique background

214
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:30,028
以及作为消防员和应急管理人员的背景
as a firefighter and emergency manager,

215
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:33,692
因此 我知道
that it was important to change the cultural approach

216
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:39,404
将文化从注重预防失败的观念转变为拥抱失败非常重要
from focusing on the idea of preventing failure to instead embracing failure,

217
00:14:39,404 --> 00:14:40,879
接受失败发生
accepting that failure happens.

218
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:44,407
促使我这样做的部分原因是我自己的经历
And part of what inspired that was both my own experience,

219
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:46,242
你知道 了解系统
you know, understanding systems,

220
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:51,225
比如建筑是如何倒塌的 市政基础设施是如何崩溃的
how like buildings fail and how civic infrastructure fails,

221
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,978
以及灾难是如何发生的
and how disasters happened,

222
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:54,684
以及灾难给人们的压力
and the strain that that puts on people.

223
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,001
如果环顾我所在工作场所的复杂性和运营规模
And saying, well, if we look at the complexity and operational scale

224
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:02,100
如果环顾我所在工作场所的复杂性和运营规模
that we have at the place of employment that I was at,

225
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,609
就会知道 如果想要真的打造出
the only way that we're really going to build and change

226
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:09,226
一个高可靠性、持续在线的环境
and become a high-reliability, always-on environment,

227
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:12,890
唯一的办法就是采用消防服务的模式
is truly to embrace the fire service approach.

228
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,925
我们知道失败会发生
Where we know that failures will happen.

229
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:18,512
不存在灾害是否发生的问题 只存在时间问题
It's not a question of if, it's a question of when.

230
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:21,775
就像我之前的消防队长说的
And then as my old fire chief would say,

231
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:25,375
不是你选择时机 而是时机选择你
you don't choose the moment, the moment chooses you.

232
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,015
你能做的唯一选择就是 在它发生前尽量做足准备
You only choose how prepared you are when it does.

233
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:28,975
哦 这句话不错
Oh, that's a good one.

234
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:32,675
所以当你第一次开始举行 “游戏日”
So when you first started doing the Game Days

235
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:36,645
并思考如何为灾难场景做准备时
and thinking about how to be prepared for disaster scenarios,

236
00:15:36,963 --> 00:15:40,225
每个人都同意了吗？你得到任何反对意见了吗？
was everyone on board with this or did you get any pushback?

237
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:41,822
所有人都认为我疯了
Everyone thought I was crazy.

238
00:15:41,822 --> 00:15:44,400
因此 肯定有人反对
So definitely there were people that resisted it.

239
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,816
有趣的是 有一种非常简单的方法可以克服这种抵制
And it's interesting because there was a really simple way of overcoming that resistance,

240
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,799
首先 创造出所谓的“冠军”
which is first creating what I call champions.

241
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,726
你要教会一小群人
You want to teach people, a small group,

242
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:58,565
如何以非常安全的方式工作
how to work in a way that is very safe

243
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:01,625
让他们经历一些考验
and then you want to give them some exposure

244
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,851
然后你就能给出一些可信的指标
and then you want to use a set of metrics where you're able to say,

245
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:09,125
你就能说 看 我们用服务中断的时间来说事
look, let's just measure how many minutes of outage there is,

246
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:14,197
我的团队经过了这种培训 这样操作之后停机时间是多少分钟
how many minutes of downtime my team has that has this training and operates this way.

247
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:17,292
用这个指标和 比方说 你的团队比较
Versus, I don't know, your team,

248
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:19,837
而你的团队没有经过这种训练
who does not have that

249
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:25,101
并且似乎认为这种培训和练习没有价值 或者不重要
and who seems to think that doing this type of training and exercises isn't valuable or isn't important.

250
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,500
你一旦这么做之后
And once you do that kind of thing,

251
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,797
所谓的“显著事件”总有一天会发生
you basically end up with what I call a compelling event.

252
00:16:31,148 --> 00:16:33,725
经常会有断电之类的事
So, often there'll be an outage or some other thing

253
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:37,107
让组织突然意识到
where the organization suddenly and starkly realizes,

254
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:41,859
哦 我的天哪 我们不能再像以前那样做事了
oh my goodness, we can't keep doing things the way that we've been doing them before.

255
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:44,525
这就是说服怀疑论者的方法
And that becomes the method you use to overcome the skeptics.

256
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:49,213
你一方面展示数据和性能数据
You use a combination of data and performance information on the one hand,

257
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:55,100
再结合指标 讲故事
coupled with metrics, and then great storytelling,

258
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,276
然后等待一个“大的” 或者说严重故障发生
and then you wait for the big one or the scary incident that happens

259
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:00,475
然后 你就可以说
and you say, you know,

260
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:02,440
如果我们要在 web 规模或者互联网规模上运维
the whole organization needs this ability

261
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,976
整个组织都需要这种应变能力
if we're going to operate at web scale or internet scale.

262
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:07,256
*发出赞同的声音*
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

263
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:11,975
所以我喜欢这个活动的原因是 它不只是停留在亚马逊内部
So what I love about this is that it didn't just stay within Amazon.

264
00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:14,375
相反 它在传播 很多其他公司也在这么做
It spread. A lot of other companies are doing it.

265
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:19,200
很多人最终接受了“为故障做好准备”的相关知识和工作方式
A lot of people have ended up embracing this knowledge and this process

266
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,846
很多人最终接受了“为故障做好准备”的相关知识和工作方式
to, you know, to be prepared.

267
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,885
那下一步是要做什么？
What is next?

268
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:27,200
我们如何将从 “游戏日” 中学到的知识
How do we continue carrying on the knowledge from Game Day

269
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,096
继续运用到未来的项目和公司中？
into future projects and future companies?

270
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,320
我喜欢把它称为趋同进化
I like to talk about it as convergent evolution.

271
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,700
每个在 web 上运行的大型组织
So every large organization that operates on the web

272
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,725
现在都采用了我提倡的事件管理基础的一个版本
has now adopted a version of both the incident management foundation

273
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:44,875
现在都采用了我提倡的事件管理基础的一个版本
that I certainly advocated for

274
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:48,425
并创立了他们自己的 “游戏日” 测试
and has created their own Game Day testing.

275
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:51,833
比如 Netflix 将其称为 “混沌猴子”
You know, Netflix calls it the Chaos Monkey.

276
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:55,497
谷歌也有他们的 Dirt 计划
And Google has their Dirt program.

277
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,439
那么你对未来的 “游戏日” 有什么寄望呢？
So what are your hopes and dreams for Game Day in the future?

278
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:03,125
首先 让我高兴的是
What I am excited about first of all

279
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,085
我们可以看到人们思维方式的转变
is that we are seeing this evolution now

280
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,693
他们抛弃了系统之间彼此孤立的狭隘观点
from a thinking of silos and thinking of systems as being disconnected to.

281
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:15,485
转而认为系统之间互相连接 依存于彼此
Systems being fundamentally interconnected, interdependent

282
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:19,300
而这些系统都是由世界各地的聪明人创造和维护的
and built and run by smart people around the world

283
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,261
是由他们创造的 宏伟的大型工程
that are trying to do great and big things.

284
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:28,140
几年前 当我刚参加工作时 对运维工作毫不关心
Years ago when I got my start, caring about operations was a backwater.

285
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,875
我觉得那非常无趣
It was not an interesting place.

286
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:34,175
然后 突然地 我们发现自己能够传播这样一种理念
And suddenly we found ourselves being able to propagate the idea

287
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:37,975
开发人员和运营人员应当团结协作
that developers and operations people working together

288
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:43,879
因为这是在万物互联的世界中 创造并应用有用的技术的唯一方式
are the only way that meaningful technology gets built and run in a connected world.

289
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:46,525
所以 我对未来的希望是
And so my hope for the future is

290
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:50,325
首先 看到越来越多的人接受这些想法 并学习它们
number one, we're seeing more and more people embracing these ideas

291
00:18:50,325 --> 00:18:51,300
首先 看到越来越多的人接受这些想法 并学习它们
and learning about them.

292
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,836
了解当你建造了人们依赖的东西时
Understanding that when you build something that people depend on,

293
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:56,730
你有义务确保
you have an obligation to make sure

294
00:18:57,225 --> 00:19:01,201
它是可信赖的、可用的、可靠的
that it's reliable, it's usable, it's dependable,

295
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:05,441
它是人们可以作为日常生活的一部分来使用的东西
it's something that people can use as part of their daily lives.

296
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:08,625
而且我们也看到了一种新的学科的诞生
But also we're seeing a new discipline emerge.

297
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,950
人们在对它展开研究
It's being studied, you know,

298
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,325
也有博士正基于这个撰写博士学位论文
there's PhD theses being written on it.

299
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:15,750
有人为它不断添砖加瓦
It's being built out constantly.

300
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,275
有人为它不断添砖加瓦
It's being built out constantly.
That's awesome.
这真是太棒了

301
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:16,400
也有人写这方面的书
There's books being written,
That's awesome.
这真是太棒了

302
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,625
也有人写这方面的书
There's books being written,

303
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,175
这个课题极受关注
there's all these new resources that aren't, you know,

304
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:24,175
远不是少数人在会议上夸夸其谈“理想世界”的状况
just a couple of people talking at a conference about how they think the world should work.

305
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:27,519
所以我的冀望是
And so my sort of inspirational hope is

306
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,750
首先 你要明白 如果你正在创造软件和技术
one, understand that if you're building software and technology that people use,

307
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,926
那你就会成为社会基础设施的一部分
you're really becoming part of the civic infrastructure.

308
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:42,075
所以作为一名消防员 我所努力贡献的一系列技能
And so the set of skills that I've tried to contribute as a firefighter

309
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:46,706
以及现如今涌现的、将这门学科进一步发展的诸多技能和技术
to technology and the skills that are now emerging that are taking that so much farther

310
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:52,175
它们会成为建造人们日常生活所依赖的东西的基础的一部分
are part of the foundation for building things that people depend on everyday.

311
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,943
很好 这个结尾真不错
Very nice. Oh, that's a great way to end.

312
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,115
Jesse 谢谢你抽出时间来
Thank you so much Jesse for your time.

313
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,125
谢谢
Yeah, thank you.

314
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:07,263
在 Jesse 看来 像 “游戏日” 或者 “混沌猴子” 这样的演习
In Jesse's vision, exercises like Game Day or Chaos Monkey

315
00:20:07,263 --> 00:20:10,543
不仅是我们不断发展的科技文化的重要组成部分
are a crucial part of our tech culture growing up,

316
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:13,503
它们对于整个社会也至关重要
but they are also crucial for society at large.

317
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:17,807
我很喜欢他对此的重视 因为他是对的
And I love that he's putting the stakes that high because he's right.

318
00:20:18,075 --> 00:20:20,715
我们的世界与我们的造物息息相关
Our world depends on the work we do.

319
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:23,070
早在 90 年代 当电话网络开始崩溃时
That much was obvious back in the 90s

320
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,550
这一点就很明显了
when telephone networks started crashing.

321
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,725
我们认知中的现代生活几乎陷于停顿
Modern life as we know it almost ground to a halt.

322
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,759
责任随创造而来
And there's a duty that goes along with that.

323
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:36,359
我们有责任关心安全和可靠性
A duty to care about security and reliability,

324
00:20:36,807 --> 00:20:39,939
关心我们造物的应变能力
about the resilience of the things we build.

325
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,440
当然 当谈到在 DevOps 中集成安全工作时
Of course, when it comes to building security into DevOps,

326
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,440
我们才刚刚开始
we're just getting started.

327
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:53,128
安全 作为一个产业 还在刚刚起步的阶段
Security is one of those... it's so in its infancy, as an industry.

328
00:20:53,704 --> 00:20:55,379
这是 Josh Bressers
That's Josh Bressers.

329
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,179
他是数据搜索软件公司 Elastic 的产品安全主管
He's the head of product security

330
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:00,330
他是数据搜索软件公司 Elastic 的产品安全主管
at a data search software startup called Elastic.

331
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:06,106
对 Josh 来说 尽管计算机行业已经成长了半个世纪左右
For Josh, even though the computer industry's been maturing for a half-century or so,

332
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:09,200
我们在这里讨论的安全问题
the kind of security we've been talking about here

333
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,538
却让人觉得它是刚刚才出现的
feels like it just came into its own.

334
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,300
实际上 我会说 作为一个专业
Practically speaking, as what I would say maybe a profession,

335
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,900
安全仍然是非常新的东西 有很多事情我们还不是很了解
security is still very new and there's a lot of things we don't understand.

336
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:21,220
但我们确实明白
Here's what we do understand though,

337
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,932
在 DevSecOps 的世界中
in a DevSecOps world,

338
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:28,388
有许多大好机会 可以供人畅想安全工作的可能性
there are some pretty sweet opportunities to get creative about what security can achieve.

339
00:21:28,775 --> 00:21:30,325
我最近和一些人讨论了一个概念
I was recently talking to somebody

340
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:34,584
他们通过观察用户行为
about a concept where they're using user behavior

341
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:38,648
来决定用户是否应该能够访问系统
to decide if a user should be able to access the system.

342
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:40,943
每个人都有特定的行为方式
Everybody has certain behaviors,

343
00:21:41,391 --> 00:21:43,167
比如他们来自哪里
be it where they're coming from,

344
00:21:43,615 --> 00:21:45,300
他们访问系统的时间
time of day they're accessing a system,

345
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,463
他们打字的方式
the way they type,

346
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:48,446
他们移动鼠标的方式
the way they move their mouse.

347
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:51,272
我认为他们很有潜力
And so they're actually one of those places that I think

348
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:56,150
如果做法得当 这种思路可以极为有效
could have some very powerful results if we can do it right,

349
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,134
也就是“注意用户在做什么”的这种思路
where we can pay attention to what someone's doing.

350
00:21:58,134 --> 00:22:01,210
比方说 我表现得很奇怪
And then let's say I'm acting weird

351
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,300
因为我刚刚扭伤了手臂
and you know, I'm weird because I just sprained my wrist.

352
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,400
但系统的另一端并不知情
But you know, the other end doesn't know that.

353
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,658
因此 它可能会说 这种行为就有些奇怪
And so it might say, all right, something's weird,

354
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:10,490
它就会说 希望你使用双因子认证登录
we want you to log in with your two-factor auth

355
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,075
并且还会给你发条短信之类的
and we're going to also send you a text message or something.

356
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:17,507
对吧？这就不只是用户名和密码了 它变成了更有趣的东西
Right? And so we've just gone from essentially username and password to something more interesting.

357
00:22:18,147 --> 00:22:24,200
所以我认为 用新的和独特的方式来看待这些问题将是关键
And so I think looking at a lot of these problems in new and unique ways is really going to be key.

358
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
在很多情况下 我们只是还没想到
And in many instances, we're just not there yet.

359
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,122
实现这一目标需要我们所描述的两大步骤
Getting there requires those two big steps we've been describing.

360
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,225
第一步 就是自动化 这很重要 因为…
Step one, it's that automation, so crucial because ...

361
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:38,499
人类很不擅长重复地做同一件事
Humans are terrible at doing the same thing over and over again.

362
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:42,545
说得对 然后 我们有了第二步 就是文化
Fair. And then we've got step two, the culture,

363
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:46,273
我们所有人都该对安全性和可靠性负起责任
all of us having a stake in security and reliability,

364
00:22:46,273 --> 00:22:48,762
无论我们的职称是什么
no matter what our job title might say.

365
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,675
当大多数人想到安全团队时
When most people think of the security team,

366
00:22:51,675 --> 00:22:53,950
他们不会认为那是一群快乐的好好先生 对吧?
they don't think of happy nice people, right?

367
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:58,671
一般印象中 这些人都很可怕 脾气暴躁 令人讨厌
It's generally speaking terrible, grumpy, annoying people,

368
00:22:58,671 --> 00:23:00,975
如果他们出现了 就会毁了你的一天
who if they show up, they're going to ruin your day.

369
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:05,151
没有人想要这样 对吧?
And nobody wants that, right?

370
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,908
但我认为我们可以克服这种偏见 我们也必须克服它
But I think we can get over that bias because we have to,

371
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:18,468
你得这么想 - 每天都有更多的安全威胁发生
think of it this way - more security threats happen every day

372
00:23:18,852 --> 00:23:23,412
而且 IT 基础设施每天都在变得规模更大、功能更强
and every day IT infrastructure is growing larger and more powerful.

373
00:23:23,925 --> 00:23:25,725
把这两个事实放在一起
Put those two truths together

374
00:23:25,725 --> 00:23:28,734
如果安全受到轻视 其后果将是灾难性的
and you better live in a world where security gets embraced.

375
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,975
我们需要一个非常 DevSecOps 的世界
A very DevSecOps world

376
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:35,455
在这个世界里 开发人员和运营人员都在提升系统的安全性
where developers and operations are upping their security games,

377
00:23:35,775 --> 00:23:37,632
提高它们的可靠性
upping their reliability games.

378
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,999
我所谈论的未来是
What I'm talking about is a future

379
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:43,407
一个自动化被整合到开发和运维的每个阶段的未来
where automation is integrated into every stage

380
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,750
一个所有人都更具全局意识的未来
and everybody's attitudes toward these issues become more holistic.

381
00:23:48,198 --> 00:23:51,350
这就是我们确保未来系统安全的方法
That's how we're going to keep tomorrow's systems safe.

382
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,550
这是我们确保电话能拨通
That's how we're going to keep the phones ringing,

383
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,748
电灯能点亮
the lights on,

384
00:23:54,748 --> 00:23:57,900
让现代生活的方方面面都健康、可靠的方法
all of modern life healthy and strong.

385
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,310
如果你查阅《福布斯》全球前 2000 公司的名单
If you pull up Forbes’ list of the global 2000 organizations,

386
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,050
也就是排名最靠前的 2000 家上市公司
that's the top 2000 public companies,

387
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:13,546
你会发现其中整整四分之一的公司都采用了 DevOps
it turns out a full quarter of them have embraced DevOps.

388
00:24:13,975 --> 00:24:17,895
集成式敏捷开发正在成为主流的工作方式
Integrated agile workplaces are becoming the rule of the land.
“集成敏捷”（Integrated Agile）是敏捷开发的一个变体
这一变体试图通过在敏捷开发和传统的瀑布开发之间寻找平衡 来克服两者的缺点

389
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:22,039
用不了几年 DevSecOps 的思考方式
And in a few years thinking in terms of DevSecOps

390
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:24,311
可能会成为技术从业者的第二天性
might become second nature.

391
00:24:25,225 --> 00:24:27,801
我们希望尽可能快
We want to go as fast as possible,

392
00:24:28,377 --> 00:24:30,775
但想在长距离比赛中提高速度
but the long game is actually faster

393
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:34,567
正需要团队中的所有成员都同心协力
when every part of the team is in the race together.

394
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:44,711
下一集 我们将面临数据的大爆炸
Next episode, we're getting hit by the data explosion.

395
00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:47,500
人类已经进入了“泽字节”时代
Humans have entered the Zettabyte era.
泽字节 = Zettabyte = ZB 是用于表示数据量的单位
1ZB 为 1*10^9 TB

396
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,188
到 2020 年 我们将在服务器上存储大约 40 泽字节的数据
By 2020, we'll be storing about 40 zettabytes of information

397
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:55,400
而这些服务器大部分甚至现在还不存在
on servers that mostly don't even exist yet.

398
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,564
但是我们该如何让这些数据有用呢？
But how are we supposed to make all that data useful?

399
00:24:59,884 --> 00:25:04,225
我们如何使用高性能计算和开源项目
How do we use high-performance computing and open source projects

400
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:06,975
让数据为我们所用呢
to get our data working for us?

401
00:25:07,103 --> 00:25:11,791
我们会在《代码英雄》第二季第 6 集中找到答案
We find out in episode 6 of Command Line Heroes.

402
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,913

It's our very own open source project

405
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:24,815
我们很高兴能见证它的诞生
