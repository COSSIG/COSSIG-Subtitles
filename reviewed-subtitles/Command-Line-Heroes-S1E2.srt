1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
这玩意开着的吗？
Is this thing on?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,000
让我们播放一段跟星球大战电影一样的开场字幕吧 第二集开始了！
Cue the epic Star Wars crawl, and, action.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
OS 战争第二部分：Linux 的崛起
Episode Two: Rise of Linux®.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,200
微软帝国控制着 90％ 的用桌面用户
The empire of Microsoft controls 90 % of desktop users.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,860
操作系统的完全标准化似乎是板上钉钉的事了
Complete standardization of operating systems seems assured.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,760
所以公司们把它们的注意力从桌面端的个人用户 转移到了专业人士上
However, the advent of the internet swerves the focus of the war from the desktop toward enterprise,

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,760
它们为了服务器的所有权打得不可开交
where all businesses scramble to claim a server of their own.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,000
但是一个有点让人意想不到的英雄出现在开源“反叛组织”中
Meanwhile, an unlikely hero arises from amongst the band of open source rebels .

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
戴着眼镜 固执的林纳斯·托瓦兹免费发布了他的 Linux® 程序
Linus Torvalds, head strong, bespectacled, releases his Linux system free of charge.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,500
微软摔了个趔趄 并且开始重新调整战略
Microsoft reels — and regroups.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,500
哦 我们极客们就是喜欢那样
Oh, the nerd in me just loves that.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,000
上一次我们讲到哪了？
So, where were we?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,300
苹果和微软互相攻伐
Apple and Microsoft were trading blows,

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,300
试图在争夺桌面用户的战争中占据主导地位
trying to dominate in a war over desktop users.

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,600
在第一集的结尾 我们看到微软获得了大部分的市场份额
By the end of episode one, we saw Microsoft claiming most of the prize.

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,000
很快 互联网的兴起以及随之而来的开发者大军
Soon, the entire landscape went through a seismic upheaval.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
让整个市场都经历了一场地震
That's all because of the rise of the internet and the army of developers that rose with it.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,340
互联网将战场从在家庭和办公室中的个人电脑用户
So the internet moves the battlefield from PC users in their home offices

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,300
转移到拥有数百台服务器的大型商业客户中
to giant business clients with hundreds of servers.

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,600
这意味着巨量资源的迁移
This is a huge resource shift.

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,600
突然间 所有相关企业不仅被迫为服务器空间和网站建设付费
Not only does every company out there wanting to remain relevant suddenly have to pay for server space and get a website built

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,000
还必须集成软件来进行资源跟踪和数据库监控等工作
they also have to integrate software to track resources, monitor databases, et cetera, et cetera.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
至少那时候大家都是这么做的 你需要很多开发人员来帮助你
You're going to need a lot of developers to help you with that. At least, back then you did.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,500
在操作系统之战的第二部分 我们将看到固有优势的巨大转变
In part two of the OS wars, we'll see how that enormous shift in priorities,

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,620
以及像林纳斯·托瓦兹和理查德·斯托尔曼这样的开源反叛者
and the work of a few open source rebels like Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman,

26
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,000
是如何成功地在微软和整个软件行业的核心引发恐惧的
managed to strike fear in the heart of Microsoft, and an entire software industry.

27
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,000
我是 Saron Yitbarek 你现在收听的是代码英雄 一款红帽公司原创的播客节目
I'm Saron Yitbarek and you're listening to Command Line Heroes, an original podcast from Red Hat.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,400
每一集 我们都会给你带来“从码开始” 用技术改变科技的人 他们的故事
In each episode, we're bringing you stories about the people who transform technology from the command line up.

29
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,800
好 想象一下你是 1991 年时的微软
Okay. Imagine for a second that you're Microsoft in 1991.

30
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,200
你自我感觉良好 对吧？
You're feeling pretty good, right?

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,400
你满怀信心 确立了全球主导地位的感觉真不错
Pretty confident. Assured global domination feels nice.

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,060
你已经掌握了与其他企业合作的艺术
You've mastered the art of partnering with other businesses,

33
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,400
但是仍然将大部分开发人员、程序员和系统管理员排除在联盟之外
but you're still pretty much cutting out the developers, programmers, and sys admins

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,600
而他们才是真正的武装力量
that are the real foot soldiers out there.

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,600
这时出现了一个叫林纳斯·托瓦兹的芬兰极客
There is this Finnish geek named Linus Torvalds.

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,000
他和一帮信奉开源的程序员开始发布 Linux
He and his team of open source programmers are starting to put out versions of Linux,

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
这个操作系统内核是由他们一起编写出来的
this OS kernel that they're duct taping together.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,150
坦白地说 如果你是微软公司
If you're Microsoft,

39
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,150
你并不会太在意 Linux 甚至不太关心开源运动
frankly, you're not too concerned about Linux or even about open source in general,

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,400
但是最终 Linux 的规模变得如此之大
but eventually, the sheer size of Linux gets so big

41
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,400
以至于微软不可能不注意到
that it becomes impossible for Microsoft not to notice.

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,000
Linux 第一个版本出现在 1991 年 当时大概有 1 万行代码
The first version comes out in 1991 and it's got maybe 10,000 lines of code.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,800
十年后 则是 300 万行代码
A decade later, there will be three million lines of code.

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
如果你想了解知道现在的 Linux 怎么样了 - 它有 2000 万行代码
And in case you're wondering, today it's at 20 million.

45
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,000
让我们在 90 年代初停留一会儿
For a moment, let's stay in the early 90s.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
那时 Linux 还没有成为我们现在所知道的庞然大物
Linux hasn't yet become the behemoth we know now.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
这只是一个正在蔓延的 拥有病毒一般感染力的奇怪操作系统
and the geeks and hackers of the world are falling in love with it.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,500
不过全世界的极客和黑客都爱上了它
and the geeks and hackers of the world are falling in love with it.

49
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,600
那时候我还太年轻 但有点希望我曾经历过那个年代
I was too young in those early days, but I sort of wish I'd been there.

50
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,000
我是说在那个时候 发现 Linux 就如同进入了一个秘密结社
I mean at that time,discovering Linux was like gaining access to a secret society.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,079
程序员与朋友们分享刻录的 Linux CD 集
Programmers would share the Linux CD set with friends the same way other people would share mixtapes of underground music.

52
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:38,000
就像其他人分享地下音乐混音带一样
the same way other people would share mixtapes of underground music.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
开发者 Tristram Oaten 讲讲你 16 岁时第一次接触 Linux 的故事吧
Developer Tristram Oaten tells the story of how he first encountered Linux when he was 16 years old.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
我和我的家人去了红海的 Hurghada 潜水度假
We went on a scuba diving holiday, my family and I, to Hurghada, which is on the Red Sea.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
那是一个美丽的地方 强烈推荐
Beautiful place, highly recommend it.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,340
也许我妈妈跟我说过不要这么做 但第一天 我还是喝了自来水
The first day, I drank the tap water. Probably, my mom told me not to.

57
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,800
所以我整个星期都病得很厉害 没法离开旅馆房间
So I was really sick the whole week — didn't leave the hotel room.

58
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,300
当时我只带了一台新安装了 Slackware Linux 的笔记本电脑
All I had with me was a laptop with a fresh install of Slackware Linux,

59
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,300
我只是听说过这玩意 现在却要尝试使用它
this thing that I'd heard about and was giving it a try.

60
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,550
我手上没有其他的应用程序
There were no extra apps,

61
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,000
我能接触的所有东西只有刻录在 8 张 CD 上的代码
just what came on the eight CDs.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,800
这种情况下 我整个星期能做的事情
By necessity, all I had to do this whole week

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,000
就是了解这个外星造物一般的系统
was to get to grips with this alien system.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,440
我阅读手册 摆弄着终端
I read man pages, played around with the terminal.

65
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,190
我记得当时我甚至不知道“.”和“..”之间的区别
I remember not knowing the difference between a single dot, meaning the current directory, and two dots, meaning the previous directory.

66
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,600
我一点头绪都没有 犯过很多错误
I had no clue. I must have made so many mistakes,

67
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
但慢慢的 在这种被迫造成的孤独中
but slowly, over the course of this forcible solitude,

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:39,000
我突破了障碍 开始明白并理解命令行到底是怎么回事
I broke through this barrier and started to understand and figure out what this command line thing was all about.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,750
假期结束时 我没有看过金字塔、尼罗河等任何埃及遗址
By the end of the holiday, I hadn't seen the pyramids, the Nile, or any Egyptian sites,

70
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,000
但我解锁了现代世界的一个奇迹
but I had unlocked one of the wonders of the modern world.

71
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,000
我接触了 Linux 接下来的事大家都知道了
I'd unlocked Linux, and the rest is history.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
你会从很多人那里听到关于这个故事的不同版本
You can hear some variation on that story from a lot of people.

73
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,000
访问 Linux 命令行是一种革命性的体验
Getting access to that Linux command line was a transformative experience.

74
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,925
它提供了源代码 我当时的感觉是 “太神奇了 ”
This thing gave me the source code. I was like, "That's amazing."

75
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,000
我们正在参加一个名为 Flock to Fedora 的 2017 年 Linux 开发者大会
We're at a 2017 Linux developers conference called Flock to Fedora.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
…非常有吸引力
... very appealing.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,300
我觉得随着我掌控这个系统越深 它就越吸引我
I felt like I had more control over the system and it just drew me in more and more.

78
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:23,800
我想 从 1995 年我第一次编译 Linux 内核那时起 我就迷上了它
So,From there, I guess, after my first Linux kernel compile in 1995, I was hooked, so, yeah.

79
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,800
这是开发者 David Cantrell 与 Joe Brockmire
Developers David Cantrell and Joe Brockmire.

80
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,000
我在 Cheap Software 转的时候发现了一套四张 CD 的 Slackware Linux
I was going through the cheap software and found a four - CD set of Slackware Linux.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,200
它看起来会非常令人兴奋而且很有趣 所以我把它带回家
And it sounded really exciting and interesting so I took it home,

82
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,300
安装在我的第二台电脑上 开始摆弄它
and installed it on a second computer, started playing with it,

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,595
有两件事情让我感到很兴奋：
and really got excited about two things.

84
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:47,302
一个是我运行的不是 Windows
One was, I was excited not to be running Windows,

85
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,111
另一个是 Linux 的开源特性
and I was excited by the open source nature of Linux.

86
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:56,780
某种程度上来说 使用命令行的人总是存在的
That access to the command line was, in some ways, always there.

87
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,000
在开源真正开始流行起来的二十年前
Decades before open source really took off,

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,600
人们总是希望能够做到完全控制机器
there was always a desire to have complete control,

89
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,000
至少…对于开发者来说是这样的
at least among developers.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,720
让我们回到操作系统大战之前的那个时代
Go way back to a time before the OS wars,

91
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,540
在苹果和微软为他们的 GUI 而战之前
before Apple and Microsoft were fighting over their GUIs.

92
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,500
那时也有代码英雄
There were command line heroes then, too.

93
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,940
保罗·琼斯教授（在线图书馆 ibiblio.org 的负责人）
Paul Jones is the director of the online library ibiblio.org.

94
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,060
就是一名那个古老年代的开发人员
He worked as a developer during those early days.

95
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,180
从本质上讲 互联网在那个时候客户端-服务器架构还是比较少的
The internet, by its nature, at that time, was less client server,

96
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,000
而更多的是点对点架构的
totally, and more peer to peer.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
确实 我们会说 某种 VAX 到 VAX 的连接
We're talking about, really, some sort of VAX to VAX,

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,400
某种科学工作站到科学工作站的连接
some sort of scientific workstation, the scientific workstation.

99
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,000
这并不意味着没有客户端-服务端的架构及应用程序
That doesn't mean that client and server relationships and applications weren't there,

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
但这的确意味着 最初的设计是思考如何实现点对点
but it does mean that the original design was to think of how to do peer - to - peer things,

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,580
它与 IBM 一直在做的东西相对立
the opposite of what IBM had been doing,

102
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:58,400
IBM 给你的只有哑终端 这种终端只能让你管理用户界面
in which they had dumb terminals that had only enough intelligence to manage the user interface,

103
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,600
却无法让你像真正的终端一样为所欲为
but not enough intelligence to actually let you do anything in the terminal that would expose anything to it.

104
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,130
当图形用户界面在普通用户中普及的同时
As popular as GUI was becoming among casual users,

105
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,500
在工程师和开发人员中总是存在着一股相反的力量
there was always a pull in the opposite direction for the engineers and developers.

106
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,510
早在 Linux 出现之前的二十世纪七八十年代
Before Linux in the 1970s and 80s,

107
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,100
这股力量就存在于 Emacs 和 GNU 中
that resistance was there, with EMACS and GNU.

108
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:25,020
斯托曼的自由软件基金会中的某些人想要使用完全命令行
W th Stallman's free software foundation, certain folks were always begging for access to the command line,

109
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,200
但直到上世纪 90 年代的 Linux 出现 才提供了前所未有的东西
but it was Linux in the 1990s that delivered like no other.

110
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:33,600
Linux 和其他开源软件的早期爱好者是都是先驱
The early lovers of Linux and other open source software were pioneers.

111
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,000
我正站在他们的肩膀上 我们都是
I'm standing on their shoulders. We all are.

112
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,800
你现在收听的是代码英雄 一款由红帽公司原创的播客
You're listening to Command Line Heroes, an original podcast from Red Hat.

113
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,000
这是操作系统大战的第二部分：Linux 崛起
This is part two of the OS wars: Rise of Linux.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,700
1998 年的时候 情况发生了变化
By 1998, things have changed.

115
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,800
Steven Vaughan-Nichols 是 zdnet.com 的特约编辑
Steven Vaughan-Nichols is a contributing editor at zdnet.com,

116
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,500
他已经写了几十年从商业方面论述技术的文章了
and he's been writing for decades about the business side of technology.

117
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,640
他将向我们讲述 Linux 是如何慢慢变得越来越流行
He describes how Linux slowly became more and more popular

118
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:15,700
直到自愿贡献者的数量远远超过了工作于 Windows 上的微软开发人员的数量
until the number of volunteer contributors was way larger than the number of Microsoft developers working on Windows.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,070
不过 Linux 桌面版本从未真正追上 Windows
Linux never really went after Microsoft's desktop customers, though,

120
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,400
这也许就是微软最开始时忽略了 Linux 及其开发者的原因
and maybe that's why Microsoft ignored them at first.

121
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Linux 真正大放光彩的地方是服务器机房
Where Linux did shine was in the server room.

122
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,390
当企业开始线上业务时
When businesses went online,

123
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,390
每个企业都需要一个满足其独特需求的解决方案
each one required a unique programming solution for their needs.

124
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,700
Windows NT 于 1993 年问世
Windows NT comes out in 1993

125
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,419
当时它已经在与其他的服务器操作系统展开竞争了
and it's competing with other server operating systems,

126
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,200
但是许多开发人员都在想
but lots of developers are thinking,

127
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,490
为什么我要傻乎乎地买 AIX 或者大型的 Windows 设备呢?
"Why am I going to buy an AIX box or a large windows box

128
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,000
我明明可以通过 Apache 来构建低成本的基于 linux 的系统
when I could set up a cheap Linux-based system with Apache?"

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
鉴于这个优点 Linux 代码已经开始渗透到几乎所有的在线机器中
Point is, Linux code started seeping into just about everything online.

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,580
让微软开始意识到并感到惊讶的是
Microsoft realizes that Linux, quite to their surprise,

131
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,700
Linux 实际上已经有了一些商业应用
is actually beginning to get some of the business,

132
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,300
不是在桌面环境 而是在商业服务器上
not so much on the desktop, but on business servers.

133
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,870
因此 他们发起了一场运动
As a result of that, they start a campaign,

134
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,380
我们称之为 FUD - 恐惧、不确定和怀疑
what we like to call FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt

135
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:17,270
他们说 “哦 Linux 这玩意 真的没有那么好 它不太可靠 你根本不能相信它”
It's not very reliable. You can't trust it with anything."

136
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,000
这种软宣传式的攻击持续了一段时间
That soft propaganda style attack goes on for a while.

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
微软也不是唯一一个对 Linux 感到紧张的公司
Microsoft wasn't the only one getting nervous about Linux, either.

138
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,600
整个行业其实都在对抗这个奇怪新人的挑战
It was really a whole industry versus that weird new guy.

139
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,000
例如 任何与 UNIX 有利害关系的人都可能将 Linux 视为篡夺者
For example, anyone with a stake in UNIX was likely to see Linux as a usurper.

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
有一个案例很著名 那就是 SCO 组织,它发行过一种 UNIX 版本
Famously, the SCO Group, which had produced a version of UNIX,

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
在过去 10 多年里发起一系列的诉讼 试图阻止 Linux 的传播
waged lawsuits for over a decade to try and stop the spread of Linux.

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
而 SCO 最终失败而且破产了
SCO ultimately failed and went bankrupt.

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
与此同时 微软一直在寻找机会
Meanwhile, Microsoft kept searching for their opening.

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
他们必须要采取动作
They were a company that needed to make a move.

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
只是不清楚具体该怎么做
It just wasn't clear what that move was going to be.

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,580
第二年 真正让微软担心的事情发生了
What will make Microsoft really concerned about

147
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,160
在 2000 年的时候
it is the next year, in 2000,

148
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,600
IBM 宣布 他们将于 2001 年投资 10 亿美元在 Linux 上
IBM will announce that they will invest a billion dollars in Linux in 2001.

149
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,650
现在 IBM 已经不再涉足个人电脑业务
Now, IBM is not really in the PC business anymore.

150
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,000
那时他们还没有走出那一步 但他们正朝着这个方向前进
They're not out yet, but they're going in that direction,

151
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,440
他们将 Linux 视为服务器和大型计算机的未来
but what they are doing is they see Linux as being the future of servers and mainframe computers,

152
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,000
在这一点上 - 剧透警告 IBM 是正确的
which, spoiler alert, IBM was correct.

153
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Linux 将主宰服务器世界
Linux is going to dominate the server world.

154
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,390
这已经不再仅仅是一群黑客所钟爱的
This was no longer just about a bunch of hackers loving their

155
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,300
对命令行绝地武士式的控制了
Jedi-like control of the command line.

156
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,400
事实上金钱的投入对 Linux 助力极大
This was about the money side working in Linux's favor in a major way.

157
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
程序员们着迷的这些东西恰好对大公司也极具吸引力
So the thing programmers are getting obsessed with also happens to be deeply attractive to big business.

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,290
但由于 FUD 的作用 一些企业对此持谨慎态度
Some businesses were wary. The FUD was having an effect.

159
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,500
他们听到开源 就想：“开源
They heard open source and thought, "Open.

160
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,000
这看起来不太可靠 很混乱 充满了 BUG”
That doesn't sound solid. It's going to be chaotic, full of bugs,"

161
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
但是金钱有一种有趣的魔力 可以说服人们不再踌躇
but money has a funny way of convincing people to get over their hangups.

162
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
甚至那些只需要网站的小公司也加入了 Linux 阵营
Even little businesses, all of which needed websites, were coming on board.

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,200
与一些昂贵的专有选择相比
The cost of working with a cheap Linux system over some expensive proprietary option,

164
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,350
使用 Linux 开销较低的优势显而易见
I mean there was really no comparison.

165
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,550
如果你是一家雇佣专业人员来构建网站的商店
there was really no comparison. If you were a shop hiring a pro to build your website,

166
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,000
那么你肯定想让他们使用 Linux
you wanted them to use Linux.

167
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,900
让我们快进几年
Fast forward a few years.

168
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,550
Linux 充当着几乎所有网站的服务器
Linux runs everybody's website.

169
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,010
Linux 已经征服了服务器世界
Linux has conquered the server world,

170
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,010
然后智能手机也随之诞生
and then, along comes the smartphone.

171
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,220
当然 苹果和他们的 iPhone 占据了相当大的市场份额
Apple and their iPhones take a sizeable share of the market,

172
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,000
而且微软也希望能进入这个市场
of course, and Microsoft hoped to get in on that,

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
但令人惊讶的是 Linux 已经等在那里并做好准备
except, surprise, Linux was there, too,

174
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,700
Linux也迫不及待要大展拳脚
ready and raring to go.

175
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,000
这是作家兼记者 James Allworth
Author and journalist James Allworth.

176
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,600
肯定还有容纳第二个竞争者的空间
There was certainly room for a second player,

177
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,780
那本可以是微软
and that could well have been Microsoft,

178
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,050
但是实际上却是 Android 而 Andrid 是基于 Linux 的
but for the fact of Android, which was fundamentally based on Linux,

179
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,920
众所周知 Android 被谷歌所收购
and because Android, famously acquired by Google,

180
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,500
现在运行在世界上大部分的智能手机上
and now running a majority of the world's smartphones,

181
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,720
谷歌在 Linux 的基础上创建了 Android
Google built it on top of that.

182
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,400
Linux 使他们能够以零成本 基于一个非常复杂的操作系统构建一个新的东西
They were able to start with a very sophisticated operating system and a cost basis of zero.

183
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,460
他们盘算着推广这个系统 并最终成功地实现了这一目标
They managed to pull it off, and it ended up

184
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:19,100
至少从操作系统的角度来看是这样 他们将微软挡在了下一代手机竞争之外
locking Microsoft out of the next generation of devices, by and large, at least from an operating system perspective.

185
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,600
为此 微软肯定对此感到非常紧张
So,they would right to be very worry about it.

186
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,300
这可是个大地震 很大程度上 微软有被埋没的风险
The ground was breaking up, big time, and Microsoft was in danger of falling into the cracks.

187
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,350
John Gossman 是微软 Azure 团队的首席架构师
John Gossman is the chief architect on the Azure team at Microsoft.

188
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,350
他还记得当时公司的迷茫
He remembers the confusion that gripped the company at that time.

189
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:42,000
像许多公司一样 微软也非常担心知识产权污染
Like a lot of companies, Microsoft was very concerned about IP pollution.

190
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,270
他们认为 如果允许开发人员使用开源代码
They thought that if you let developers use open source

191
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:52,000
即使只是将一些代码复制粘贴到某些产品中
they would likely just copy and paste bits of code into some product

192
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
也会让某种病毒式的许可证生效从而引发未知的风险…
and then some sort of a viral license might take effect that ...

193
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,850
他们也很困惑 我认为 这跟公司文化有关
And they were also very confused, I think, it was just culturally,

194
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,000
很多公司 包括微软
a lot of companies, Microsoft included,

195
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,900
对开源开发的意义和商业模式之间的分歧感到困惑
were confused on the difference between what open source development meant and what the business model was.

196
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:15,000
有一种观点认为 开源意味着你所有的软件都是免费的 人们永远不会付钱
This is kind of idea that open source meant that all your software was free and people were never going to pay anything.

197
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,230
任何习惯于投资于旧的、专有软件模式的人
Anybody invested in the old, proprietary model of software

198
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,500
都会觉得这里发生的一切对他们构成了威胁
is going to feel threatened by what's happening here.

199
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,090
当你威胁到像微软这样的大公司时
When you threaten an enormous company like Microsoft,

200
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,090
是的 他们一定会做出反应
Yeah, you can bet they're going to react.

201
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,400
他们推动所有这些 FUD
It makes sense they were pushing all that FUD —

202
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,000
恐惧、不确定性和怀疑
fear, uncertainty and doubt.

203
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,200
当时 商业运作的方式基本上就是相互竞争
At the time, an “ us versus them ” attitude was pretty much how business worked.

204
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
不过 如果是其他公司的话
If they'd been any other company, though,

205
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,200
他们可能还会一直怀恨在心 抱残守缺
they might have kept that old grudge, that old thinking,

206
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,700
但到了 2013 年的微软 一切都变了
but then, in 2013, everything changes.

207
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,660
微软的云计算服务 Azure 上线了
Microsoft's cloud computing service, Azure, goes online

208
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,600
令人震惊的是 它从第一天开始就提供了 Linux 虚拟机
and, shockingly, it offers Linux virtual machines from day one.

209
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,150
史蒂夫·鲍尔默,这位把 Linux 称为癌症的首席执行官
Steve Ballmer, the CEO who called Linux a cancer,

210
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,000
已经离开了
he's out,

211
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,300
代替他的是一位新的有远见的首席执行官 - 萨提亚·纳德拉
and a new forward - thinking CEO, Satya Nadella, has been brought in.

212
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:07,620
萨提亚有不同的看法
Satya has a different attitude.

213
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,000
他属于另一个世代,比保罗、比尔和史蒂夫更年轻的世代
He's another generation. He's a generation younger than Paul and Bill and Steve were,

214
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,400
他对开源有不同的看法
and had a different perspective on open source.

215
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
这是 John Gossman 他还是来自微软 Azure 团队
John Gossman, again, from Microsoft's Azure team.

216
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,670
大约四年前 我们在 Azure 中添加了 Linux 支持
We added Linux support into Azure about four years ago,

217
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,000
迫于求生欲
and that was for very pragmatic reasons.

218
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
如果访问任何一家企业客户
If you go to any enterprise customer,

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,580
你都会发现
 you will find that

220
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:38,510
他们并不是现在才决定是用 Windows 还是 Linux
they are not trying to decide whether to use Windows to use Linux

221
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,000
或是用 .NET 还是 Java
or to use Linux

222
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,300
他们在很久以前就做出了决定 - 大约 15 年前
They made all those decisions a long time ago — about 15 years or so ago,

223
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,800
虽然对此有一些争论
there was some of this argument.

224
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,590
现在 我见过的每一家公司都混合了
Now, every company that I have ever seen has a mix of

225
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,342
Linux 和 Java、Windows 和 .NET、
Linux and Java and Windows and .NET 

226
00:14:56,342 --> 00:15:00,170
SQL Server、Oracle 和 MySQL 等
and SQL Server and Oracle and MySQL

227
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,900
这些基于专有源代码的产品和开放源代码的产品
— proprietary source code - based products and open source code products.

228
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,100
如果你打算运维一个云服务
And if you're going to operate a cloud

229
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:14,300
允许这些公司在云上运行他们的业务
you're going to allow and enable those companies to run their businesses on the cloud,

230
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,000
那么你根本不能告诉他们
you simply cannot tell them,

231
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
“你可以使用这个软件 不能使用那个软件 ”
"You can use this software but you can't use this software."

232
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,400
这正是萨提亚·纳德拉采纳的哲学思想
That's exactly the philosophy that Satya Nadella adopted.

233
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,400
2014 年秋季 他站在舞台上
In the fall of 2014, he gets up on stage

234
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,400
希望传递一个重要信息
and he wants to get across one big, fat point.

235
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,000
“微软爱 Linux”
Microsoft loves Linux.

236
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,410
他接着说 “20% 的 Azure 业务已经是 Linux 了
He goes on to say that 20 % of Azure is already Linux

237
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,840
微软将始终对 Linux 发行版提供一流的支持”
and that Microsoft will always have first - class support for Linux distros.

238
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,000
没有哪怕一丝对开源的宿怨
There's not even a whiff of that old antagonism toward open source.

239
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,880
为了说明这一点
To drive the point home,

240
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,880
在他们的背后有一个巨大的标志 上面写着：
there's literally a giant sign behind them that reads,

241
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,270
“Microsoft ❤️ Linux”
"Microsoft hearts Linux."

242
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,000
噢 对我们中的一些人来说 这种转变有点令人震惊
Aww. For some of us, that turnaround was a bit of a shock,

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,600
但实际上 无需如此震惊
but really, it shouldn't have been.

244
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,600
下面是 Steven Levy 一名科技记者兼作家
Here's Steven Levy, a tech journalist and author.

245
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:08,000
当你在踢足球的时候 如果草坪变滑了
When you're playing a football game and the turf becomes really slick,

246
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
换种不同的鞋子 才能继续在上面玩耍
maybe you switch to a different kind of footwear in order to play on that turf.

247
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,220
微软当初就是这么做的
That's what they were doing.

248
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,600
他们不能否认现实 而且他们也是聪明人
They can't deny reality and there are smart people there

249
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:27,980
所以他们必须意识到 这就是这个世界的运行方式
so they had to realize that this is the way the world is and put aside what they said earlier,

250
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,670
即使他们有一点尴尬
even though they might be a little embarrassed

251
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,200
但是不管他们早些时候说了什么现在都要抛开
at their earlier statements,

252
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,260
不然让他们之前那些“开源多么可怕”的言论影响到现在的决策
but it would be crazy to let their statements about how horrible open source was earlier,

253
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,600
才真的是不明智之举
affect their smart decisions now.

254
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,000
微软低下了它高傲的头
Microsoft swallowed its pride in a big way.

255
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,900
你可能还记得苹果公司
You might remember that Apple,

256
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:52,300
经过多年的孤立无援 最终转向与微软构建合作伙伴关系
after years of splendid isolation, finally shifted toward a partnership with Microsoft.

257
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,300
现在轮到微软进行 180 度转变了
Well,Now it was Microsoft's turn to do a 180.

258
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,300
经过多年的与开源方式的战斗后
After years of battling the open source approach,

259
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,000
他们正在重塑自己
they were reinventing themselves.

260
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,600
要么改变 要么死亡
It was change or perish.

261
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,000
下一个发言的是 Steven Vaughan-Nichols
Steven Vaughan-Nichols.

262
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,380
即使是像微软这样规模的公司
Even a company the size of Microsoft

263
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:17,000
也无法与数千个开发着包括 Linux 在内的各类开源大项目的开发者竞争
simply can't compete with the thousands of open source developers working on all these other major projects, including Linux.

264
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,760
很长时间以来他们都不愿意合作
They were very loath e to do so for a long time.

265
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,810
前微软首席执行官史蒂夫·鲍尔默对 Linux 用接近信仰的方式深恶痛绝
The former Microsoft CEO, Steve Ballmer, hated Linux with a passion.

266
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,000
由于它使用的 GPL 许可证 他视 Linux 为一种癌症
Because of its GPL license, it was a cancer,

267
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,010
不过一旦鲍尔默被扫地出门
but once Ballmer was finally shown the door,

268
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,750
新的微软领导层表示
the new Microsoft leadership said,

269
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,077
“这就好像试图命令潮流不要过来
"This is like trying to order the tide to stop coming in.

270
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:44,077
但潮水依然会不断涌进来
The tide is going to keep coming in.

271
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:49,000
我们应该与 Linux 合作 而不是与之对抗 ”
We should work with Linux, not against it."

272
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,330
说真的 线上技术史中最大的胜利之一
Really, one of the big wins of the history of online techs

273
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:58,000
就是微软终于做出这个改变 而且还成功了
is the way Microsoft was able to make this pivit when they finally decided to.

274
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,110
当然 Linux 的老支持者对微软支持开源一事仍持怀疑态度
Of course, older hard core Linux supporters were pretty sceptical when Microsoft showed up at the open source table.

275
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,800
他们不确定能不能欢迎这些家伙
They weren't sure if they can embrace these guys.

276
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,700
但正如 Vaughan-Nichols 所说
But, as Vaughan-Nichols  points out,

277
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,480
如今的微软已不再是上一辈人所见的微软了
today's Microsoft simply is not your mom and dad's Microsoft.

278
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,160
2017 年的微软既不是史蒂夫·鲍尔默的微软
Microsoft 2017 is not Steve Ballffmer's Microsoft,

279
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,000
也不是比尔·盖茨的微软
nor is it Bill Gates' Microsoft.

280
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
这是一家完全不同的公司 有着完全不同的理念
It's an entirely different company with a very different approach

281
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:33,000
而且 一旦使用了开源 你就无法退回到之前的阶段
and, again, once you start using open source, it's not like you can really pull back.

282
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
开源已经吞噬了整个技术世界
For that matter, Open source has devoured the entire technology world.

283
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,070
从未听说过 Linux 的人可能对它并不了解
People who have never heard of Linux as such, don't know it,

284
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,000
但是每次他们访问 Facebook 他们都在运行 Linux
but every time they're on Facebook, they're running Linux.

285
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
每次执行谷歌搜索时 你都在运行 Linux
Every time you do a Google search, you're running Linux.

286
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,020
每次你用 Android 手机 你都在运行 Linux
Every time you do anything with your Android phone, you're running Linux again.

287
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,020
事实上它早已无处不在
It literally is everywhere,

288
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,580
微软无法阻止它
and Microsoft can't stop that,

289
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:14,000
而且我认为 以为微软想用某种方式接管它的想法太天真了
and thinking that Microsoft can somehow take it all over, I think is naïve.

290
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
开源支持者可能一直担心微软会像混入羊群中的狼一样
So Open source supporters might have been worrying about Microsoft coming in like a wolf in the flock,

291
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,600
但事实是 开源软件的本质保护了它 让它无法被完全控制
but the truth is, the very nature of open source software protects it from total domination.

292
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,500
没有一家公司能够拥有 Linux 并以某种特定的方式控制它
No single company can own Linux and control it in any specific way.

293
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,000
Greg Kroah-Hartman 是 Linux 基金会的一名成员
Greg Kroah-Hartman is a fellow at the Linux Foundation.

294
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,300
每个公司和个人都因为自己的利益对 Linux 做出贡献
Every company and every individual contributes to Linux in a selfish manner.

295
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,000
他们之所以这样做是因为他们想要解决他们所面临的问题
They're doing so because they want to solve a problem that they have,

296
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,650
可能是硬件无法工作 或者是他们想要添加一个新功能来做其他事情
be it hardware isn't working , or they want to add a new feature to do something else,

297
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,600
又或者想引导 Linux 的开发轨道 这样他们的新产品就能使用它
or want to take it in a direction that they'll build that they can use for their product.

298
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,550
这很棒 因为他们会把代码贡献回去 此后每个人都会从中受益
That's great, because then everybody benefits from that because they're releasing the code back,

299
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,000
这样每个人都可以用到这份代码
so everybody can use it.

300
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,207
正是因为这种自私 所有的公司 所有的人都能从中受益
So,It's because of that selfishness that all companies and all people have, everybody benefits.

301
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,380
微软已经意识到 在即将到来的云战争中
Microsoft has realized that in the coming cloud wars,

302
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,600
与 Linux 对抗就好比与空气斗智斗勇
fighting Linux would be like going to war with, well, a cloud.

303
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,000
Linux 和开源不是敌人 它们是空气
Linux and open source aren't the enemy, they're the atmosphere.

304
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
如今 微软以白金会员的身份加入了 Linux 基金会
Today, Microsoft has joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member.

305
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,500
他们成为 GitHub 开源项目的头号贡献者
They became the number one contributor to open source on GitHub.

306
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,800
2017 年 9 月 他们甚至加入了开源促进联盟（OSI）
In September, 2017, they even joined the Open Source Initiative.

307
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,350
现在 微软在开源许可证下发布了很多代码
These days, Microsoft releases a lot of its code under open licenses.

308
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,700
微软的 John Gossman 描述了他们开源 .NET 时所发生的事情
Microsoft's John Gossman describes what happened when they open sourced .NET.

309
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,700
起初 他们并不认为自己能得到什么回报
At first, they didn't really think they'd get much back.

310
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,600
我们本没有指望来自社区的贡献
We didn't count on contributions from the community,

311
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:51,000
然而 三年后 超过 50% 的对 .NET 框架库的贡献来自于微软之外
and yet, three years in, over 50 per cent of the contributions to the .NET framework libraries, now, are coming from outside of Microsoft.

312
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,100
这些是大量的代码
This includes big pieces of code.

313
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,800
三星为 .NET 提供了 ARM 支持
Samsung has contributed ARM support to .NET.

314
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,360
Intel 和 ARM 以及其他一些芯片厂商
Intel and ARM and a couple other chip

315
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,000
已经为 .NET 框架贡献了特定于他们处理器的代码
people have contributed code generation specific for their processors to the .NET framework,

316
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,350
以及数量惊人的修复 bug、性能改进等等
as well as a surprising number of fixes, performance improvements , and stuff

317
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,000
既有单个贡献者也有社区
- from just individual contributors to the community.

318
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,550
直到几年前 今天的这个微软
Up until a few years ago, the Microsoft we have today,

319
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,000
这个开放的微软 还是不可想象的
this open Microsoft, would have been unthinkable.

320
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
我是 Saron Yitbarek 这里是代码英雄
I'm Saron Yitbarek, and this is Command Line Heroes.

321
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,440
好吧 我们已经看到了为了赢得数百万桌面用户的爱而战的激烈场面
Okay, we've seen titanic battles for the love of millions of desktop users.

322
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,780
我们已经看到开源软件在专有软件巨头的背后悄然崛起
We've seen open source software creep up

323
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,220
并攫取了巨大的市场份额
behind the proprietary titans, and nab huge market share.

324
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,650
我们已经看到了一批批的代码英雄
We've seen fleets of command line heroes

325
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,000
将编程领域变成了我你今天看到的这个样子
transform the programming landscape into the one handed down to people like me and you.

326
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,600
如今 大企业正在吸收开源软件
Today, big business is absorbing open source software,

327
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,000
通过这一切 每个人都从他人那里受益
and through it all, everybody is still borrowing from everybody.

328
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
在技术的西部荒野 一贯如此
In the tech wild west, it's always been that way.

329
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
苹果受到施乐（Xerox）的启发 微软受到苹果的启发
Apple gets inspired by Xerox, Microsoft gets inspired by Apple,

330
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Linux 受到 UNIX 的启发
Linux gets inspired by UNIX.

331
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
进化、借鉴、不断成长
Evolve, borrow, constantly grow.

332
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,620
如果比喻成大卫和歌利亚的话 开源软件不再是大卫
In David and Goliath terms, open source software is no longer a David,

333
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,430
但是 你知道吗？它也不是歌利亚
but, you know what? It's not even Goliath, either.

334
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,760
开源已经超越了这些角色
Open source has transcended.

335
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,760
它成为了其他人战斗的战场
It's become the battlefield that others fight on.

336
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,460
随着开源变得不可避免
So the open source approach becomes inevitable,

337
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,390
新的战争
new wars,

338
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,450
那些在云计算中进行的战争
wars that are fought in the cloud,

339
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,450
那些在开源战场上进行的战争正在加剧
wars that are fought on the open source battlefield, are ramping up.

340
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
这是 Steven Levy 他是一名作者
Here's author Steven Levy.

341
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,330
基本上 到目前为止
Basically, right now,

342
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,000
基本上 到目前为止 包括微软在内 有四到五家公司
Basically, right now, we have four or five companies, if you count Microsoft,

343
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,170
正以各种方式
they in various ways

344
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:54,720
努力把自己打造成为全方位的平台 比如人工智能领域
are fighting to be the platform for all we do, for artificial intelligence, say.

345
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,620
你能看到智能助手之间的战争 你猜怎么着？
You see wars between intelligent assistants, and guess what?

346
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,090
苹果有一个智能助手 叫 Siri
Apple has an intelligent assistant, Siri.

347
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,130
微软有一个 叫 Cortana
Microsoft has one, Cortana.

348
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:08,000
谷歌有谷歌助手
Google has the Google Assistant.

349
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,620
三星也有一个智能助手
Samsung has an intelligent assistant.

350
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,620
亚马逊也有一个 叫 Alexa
Amazon has one, Alexa.

351
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,800
我们看到这些战斗遍布各地
We see these battles shifting to different areas, there.

352
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,000
也许 你可以说 最热门的人工智能平台
Maybe, you could say, the hottest one is would be, whose AI platform

353
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
将控制我们生活中所有的东西
is going to control all the stuff in our lives there,

354
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
而这五家公司就是在为此而争斗
and those five companies are all competing for that.

355
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,800
如果你正在寻找另一个反叛者
If you're looking for another rebel

356
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,000
它们就像 Linux 奇袭微软那样
that's going to sneak up behind Facebook or

357
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,450
偷偷躲在 Facebook、谷歌或亚马逊身后
Google or Amazon and blindside them the way Linux blindsided Microsoft,

358
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,000
你也许要等很久 因为正如作家 James Allworth 所指出的
you might be looking a long time, because as author James Allworth points out,

359
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
成为一个真正的反叛者只会变得越来越难
being a true rebel is only getting harder and harder.

360
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:51,400
规模一直以来都是一种优势 但规模优势本质上…
Scale's always been an advantage but the nature of scale advantages are almost ...

361
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,000
怎么说呢 我认为以前它们在本质上是线性的
Whereas, I think previously they were more linear in nature,

362
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
现在它们在本质上是指数型的了
now it's more exponential in nature,

363
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,950
所以 一旦你开始以某种方法走在前面
and so, once you start to get out in front with something like this ,

364
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,600
另一个新玩家要想赶上来就变得越来越难了
it becomes harder and harder for a new player to come in and catch up.

365
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,700
我认为在互联网时代这大体来说来说是正确的
I think this is true of the internet era in general,

366
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:18,000
无论是因为规模 还是数据赋予组织的竞争力的重要性和优势
whether it's scale like that or the importance and advantages that data bestow on an organization in terms of its ability to compete.

367
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
一旦你走在前面 你就会吸引更多的客户
Once you get out in front, you attract more customers,

368
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,250
这就给了你更多的数据 让你能做得更好
and then that gives you more data and that enables you to do an even better job,

369
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,430
这之后 客户还有什么理由选择排名第二的公司呢
and then, why on earth would you want to go with the number two player,

370
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,000
难道是因为因为他们落后了这么远么？
because they're so far behind?

371
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
我认为在云的时代这个逻辑也不会有什么不同
I think it's going to be no different in cloud.

372
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:40,400
这个故事始于史蒂夫·乔布斯和比尔·盖茨这样的非凡的英雄
This story began with singular heroes like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates,

373
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,000
但科技的进步已经呈现出一种众包、自有生命的感觉
but the progress of technology has taken on a crowdsourced, organic feel.

374
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
我认为据说我们的开源英雄林纳斯·托瓦兹
I think it's telling that our open source hero, Linus Torvalds,

375
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
在第一次发明 Linux 内核时甚至没有一个真正的计划
didn't even have a real plan when he first invented the Linux kernel.

376
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,600
他无疑是一位才华横溢的年轻开发者
He was a brilliant, young developer for sure,

377
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,000
但他也像潮汐前的一滴水一样
but he was also like a single drop of water at the very front of a tidal wave.

378
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
变革是不可避免的
The revolution was inevitable.

379
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,000
据估计 对于一家专有软件公司来说
It's been estimated that for a proprietary company to create

380
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,700
用他们老式的、专有的方式创建一个 Linux 发行版
a Linux distribution in their old - fashioned, proprietary way,

381
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,450
将花费他们超过 100 亿美元
it would cost them well over $10 billion.

382
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,000
这说明了开源的力量
That points to the power of open source.

383
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
最后 这并不是一个专有模型所能与之竞争的东西
In the end, it's not something that a proprietary model is going to compete with.

384
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
成功的公司必须保持开放
Successful companies have to remain open.

385
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,500
这是最大、最终极的教训
That's the big, ultimate lesson in all this.

386
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,000
还有一点要记住：当我们团结在一起的时候
Something else to keep in mind: When we're wired together,

387
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,660
我们在已有基础上成长和建设的能力是无限的
our capacity to grow and build on what we've already accomplished becomes limitless.

388
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,500
不管这些公司有多大 我们都不必坐等他们给我们更好的东西
As big as these companies get, we don't have to sit around waiting for them to give us something better.

389
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,800
想想那些为了纯粹的创造乐趣而学习编码的新开发者
Think about the new developer who learns to code for the sheer joy of creating,

390
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,000
那些自己动手丰衣足食的人
the mom who decides that if nobody's going to build what she needs, then she'll build it herself.

391
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,780
未来的优秀程序员不论来自何方
Wherever tomorrow's great programmers come from,

392
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:57,400
只要能够访问代码 他们就能构建下一个大项目
they're always going to have the capacity to build the next big thing, so long as there's access to the command line.

393
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,401
以上就是我们关于操作系统战争的故事
That's it for our two - part tale on the OS wars

394
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:15,140
这场战争塑造了我们的数字生活的形态
that shaped our digital lives.

395
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,000
争夺主导地位的斗争从桌面转移到了服务器机房
The struggle for dominance moved from the desktop to the server room,

396
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
最终进入了云计算领域
and ultimately into the cloud.

397
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,650
过去的敌人难以置信地变成了盟友
Old enemies became unlikely allies,

398
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,650
众包的未来让一切都变得开放
and a crowdsourced future left everything open.

399
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:31,310
听着 我知道 在这段历史之旅中 还有很多英雄我们没有提到 
Listen, I know, there are a hundred other heroes we didn't have space for in this history trip,

400
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:38,056
所以给我们写信吧 分享你的故事 我恭候佳音
so drop us a line. Share your story. Redhat.com/commandlineheroes. I'm listening.

401
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,640
在本季剩下的时间里 我们将学习今天的英雄们在创造什么
We're spending the rest of the season learning what today's heroes are creating,

402
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,400
以及他们要经历什么样的战斗才能将他们的创造物带入我们的生活
and what battles they're going through to bring their creations to life.

403
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,350
让我们从壮丽的编程一线 回来看看更多的传奇故事吧
Come back for more tales — from the epic front lines of programming.

404
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,670
我们每两周放一集新的播客
We drop a new episode every two weeks.

405
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:59,000
几周后 我们将为你带来第三集：敏捷革命
In a couple weeks' time, we bring you episode three: the Agile Revolution.

406
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
代码英雄是一款红帽公司原创的播客
Command Line Heroes is an original podcast from Red Hat.

407
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,000
