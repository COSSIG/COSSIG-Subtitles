1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,882
在 2018 年 7 月 12 日的早晨
On the morning of July 12, 2018,

2
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:12,482
世界各地的 Python 社区成员
members of the Python community all around the globe

3
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:16,948
从床上爬起来 拿起咖啡 打开了自己的电脑
woke up, grabbed a cup of coffee and popped open their laptops.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,310
随后 一个接一个地
Then one by one,

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,304
看见了一条消息 它来自他们仁慈的独裁者：
they discovered a message from their benevolent dictator.

6
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:27,352
吉多·范罗苏姆 编程语言 Python 之父
Guido van Rossum, the man who invented Python,

7
00:00:27,544 --> 00:00:30,056
这是世界上最伟大的编程语言之一
one of the world's greatest programming languages,

8
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:32,867
也许没有之一
maybe the greatest programming language,

9
00:00:33,123 --> 00:00:34,615
他面向 Python 社区的全体成员写下这条消息
had written to them all.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,767
我们不难想象出 Python 的粉丝们阅读这条消息时的画面
So imagine all those Python fans reading these words.

11
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:40,355
“我没想到在我已经如此努力的情况下
I don't ever want to have to fight so hard

12
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:42,677
仍有这么多人对我的决策不满
and find that so many people despise my decisions.

13
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:44,919
我想把自己从决策过程中完全抽离出来
I would like to remove myself entirely from the decision process

14
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:48,903
给自己一个永久的假期 让自己一辈子都不做仁慈的独裁者
by giving myself a permanent vacation from being benevolent dictator for life.

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,348
你们都要靠自己了
You will all be on your own.

16
00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:55,432
我不会指定继任者
I am not going to appoint a successor.

17
00:00:55,752 --> 00:00:56,700
那么你们接下来要如何做呢
What are you going to do.

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,712
创立民主制度吗？或者保持无政府状态？”
Create a democracy? Anarchy?

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,099
在这条简短却惊人的消息发布之后
With that simple but earth-shattering note,

20
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,735
吉多·范罗苏姆
Guido van Rossum,

21
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:08,527
这个被 Python 社区追随了几十年的人…
the man that the Python community had been following for decades ...

22
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:11,039
好吧 他基本上就这样退出了
Well, he basically just bowed out.

23
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:14,328
这条消息被命名为 “权力交接”
His message was titled "Transfer of Power,"

24
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:18,175
它将永久的改变 Python 的格局
and it would change the landscape of the Python language forever.

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,850
不过除此之外 它又引出一个问题
But more than that, it called into question

26
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,794
所有的这些编程语言在未来要怎样衍变与壮大呢？
how all our programing languages were going to evolve and thrive in the future.

27
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,898
是否应该由一个仁慈的独裁者把控
Were languages supposed to be run by one Benevolent Dictator,

28
00:01:31,898 --> 00:01:33,898
赋予它们形体和一致性？
giving them shape and coherence?

29
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:39,151
又或者 在开源世界里 编程语言的发展与变化是否应该更像口语
Or, in our open source world, were languages more like spoken languages,

30
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:41,200
取决于所有语言使用者的行为？
things that grow and react

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,586
取决于所有语言使用者的行为？
according to the behavior of a whole bunch of different speakers?

32
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:50,080
Python 社区 这个成长速度远超其他语言的社区
The Python community, the fastest growing community of any language out there

33
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,606
很快就会找到这个问题的答案
was about to find out.

34
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:57,360
我是 Saron Yitbarek
I'm Saron Yitbarek,

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,216
这里是《代码英雄》第三季
and this is season 3 of Command Line Heroes,

36
00:02:01,216 --> 00:02:03,216
一档来自红帽的原创播客
an original podcast from Red Hat.

37
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,363
在上一季的《代码英雄》里
Last season on Command Line Heroes,

38
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,323
我们探索了广袤天地
we explored a huge stretch of territory,

39
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:14,243
从游戏主题出发 到失败的艺术 再到无服务器开发
from gaming, to the art of the fail, to serverless development.

40
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:19,750
最后我们甚至追踪了一台在火星表面 来自 NASA 的火星车
We even ended up tracking one of NASA's rovers across the surface of Mars.

41
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,716
但是真正抓住每个人想象力的一集 似乎是
But there is one episode that seemed to really capture everyone's imagination

42
00:02:25,164 --> 00:02:26,832
格蕾丝·赫柏的故事
the story of Grace Hopper.

43
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:28,947
她参与开发的编译器
Her work on compilers

44
00:02:28,947 --> 00:02:32,419
导致了世上第一个高级编程语言 COBOL 的诞生
led to the first high-level programming language, COBOL.

45
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:36,600
我们随后意识到 Grace Hopper 的故事
We realized afterward that Grace Hopper's story was

46
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,312
不过是万千个塑造了软件开发与运维的世界的故事之一
just one of so many stories of languages shaping the world of development and ops.

47
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:46,808
新的编程语言使得我们可以连通人类与机器
New programming languages allow us to bridge humans and machines.

48
00:02:47,128 --> 00:02:50,507
它们打开了一扇扇通往无限可能的大门
They open gateways toward amazing new possibilities.

49
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,098
因此 第三季将全部围绕这些语言展开
So, season 3 is all about those languages.

50
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,800
我们会谈论 JavaScript、BASIC、Go 以及 Perl
We're talking JavaScript, we're talking BASIC, Go, Perl.

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
当然 还有 Python
And yes, we're talking Python.

52
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,413
我们的旅程将从 Python 开始
Python is where our journey begins

53
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:06,132
顺着 Python 的故事
because by following the tale of Python,

54
00:03:06,324 --> 00:03:11,398
我们会学到一个与所有编程语言未来相关的至关重要的事实
we learn a crucial truth about the future of all our programming languages.

55
00:03:15,686 --> 00:03:19,507
在 Python 的仁慈的独裁者放弃王座之后
After Python's benevolent dictator abandoned his throne,

56
00:03:19,827 --> 00:03:23,667
整个 Python 社区…呃 有些迷茫
the Python community was ... yeah, a bit lost.

57
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:27,459
你要如何在独裁者退位之后组织工作呢？
How do you organize things after a dictator steps down?

58
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:32,527
有人提议使用长老教会式的架构
Somebody suggested they can model their structure after the Presbyterian church.
长老宗是起源于苏格兰的基督教新教教派 其教会称为长老教会
长老宗采用代议民主制度进行管理 由信徒群众选出长老组成议会来统辖各个地区教会

59
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,416
这主意没能经得起考验
That idea didn't stick.

60
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:37,738
要弄清楚 Python 是如何重新找到领导方式的
To understand how Python did reorganize

61
00:03:37,738 --> 00:03:40,454
并了解这对其它语言的未来有什么意义
and what it means for the future of languages in general,

62
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:44,438
我们必须要回到 Python 故事的源头
we have to go back to the origin of the Python tale.

63
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,713
我所有代码都用 C 写 这让工作变得有些枯燥
Well, I'm writing all this code in C and it's getting kind of tedious.

64
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:55,721
本尊驾到：吉多·范罗苏姆 Python 的仁慈的独裁者
That's the man himself, Guido van Rossum, Python's Benevolent Dictator.

65
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:58,100
范罗苏姆曾经为
Van Rossum had worked for years at

66
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,764
阿姆斯特丹著名的 CWI 工作数年
Amsterdam's famous Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica,
CWI = 荷兰国家数学与计算机科学研究中心 原文为荷兰语

67
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:05,575
在那里他协助开发了 ABC 编程语言
where he helped develop the ABC programming language.
ABC 被认为是吉多发明 Python 时非常重要的灵感来源

68
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:09,431
现在 他将描述他使用 C 工作时
Here, he's describing the moment he was working in C

69
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,574
发现对一个全新编程语言产生需求的时刻
and saw a need for a brand new language.

70
00:04:13,022 --> 00:04:18,747
仍然感觉还是有着很多 bug 并且开发速度缓慢
It still felt like there were lots of bugs and it was just slow going.

71
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:23,950
我在想 呃 如果这里支持 ABC 语言
I was thinking, hmm, if we had an ABC implementation here,

72
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,123
我可以在十五分钟内写出整个登录程序
I would just write a whole login program in 15 minutes,

73
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:31,553
然后我可以接着开发账户管理之类的功能
and then I would move onto the account management program or something,

74
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:34,149
但是用 C 进行开发 却要花掉我一整个星期
and in C, it takes me a week each.

75
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:39,325
我开始设想 要提出一种
I somehow started thinking about coming up with a way

76
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:45,549
可以在 Amoeba 环境中使用 ABC 语言特性的方法
to use some of ABC's features in the Amoeba environment.

77
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:48,572
在研究编程语言的历史时我们发现
Here's something we discovered

78
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:51,148
在研究编程语言的历史时我们发现
in studying the history of programming languages.

79
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,174
没有什么东西是全新的
There's no such thing as brand new.

80
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,366
它们全都是为了拼凑出解决方案而从旧语言借鉴来的
They all borrow from old languages in order to cobble together solutions.

81
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:01,460
语言会不断的变化、发展、开枝散叶
Languages morph, they evolve, they branch.

82
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:05,316
当范罗苏姆被种种可能性弄得迷茫时
When van Rossum was getting frustrated with the possibilities out there,

83
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:10,452
他设想出一个可以弥合 C 与 Shell 编程两者间隙的编程语言
he imagined a language that could bridge the gap between C and shell programming.

84
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,882
一些场景下使用 C 语言往往是牛刀杀鸡
C was often overkill,

85
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:15,650
与此同时 用 Shell 脚本又常常让人感到繁琐
but at the same time, shell scripts felt too cumbersome.

86
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:21,618
二者之间的最佳结合点 正是 Python 的栖身之处
There was a sweet spot between the two, and that was a spot that Python filled.

87
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:25,073
当范罗苏姆 在 1991 年首次发布 Python 时
When van Rossum first released Python in 1991,

88
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:28,609
它的影响犹如神启 尤其是对系统管理员而言
it was a revelation, for sysadmins especially.

89
00:05:29,057 --> 00:05:31,825
这是一种前无来者 功能全面的脚本语言
Here was a full-featured scripting language

90
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,875
这是一种前无来者 功能全面的脚本语言
unlike anything that had come before.

91
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:37,126
第一次使用 Python 时
The first time that I used Python,

92
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:38,788
我立即就爱上了它
I absolutely fell in love with it.

93
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,382
这是 Emily Morehouse
That's Emily Morehouse,

94
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:44,525
目前 Python 核心开发者中的五位女性之一
one of five women currently working as a core developer on Python.

95
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:50,173
我最初学习的是 C++ 它与 Python 有巨大的不同
I think seeing such a stark difference between a first language like C++

96
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:52,173
在换用 Python 之后 我觉得
and then moving into something like Python,

97
00:05:52,558 --> 00:05:58,281
你能通过感受这种不同 感受到 Python 在设计上的优雅之处
you are really able to see the elegance of the language and the language design itself.

98
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,825
你不必去应付
You're not necessarily having to deal with

99
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:05,150
内存管理的毛糙的底层实现细节
any of the hairy implementation details of memory management,

100
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:11,038
它可以既快又好地构建一些项目
and it was such a great way to build things so much faster,

101
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,984
更不必说它还有着如此广泛的应用领域
and build things for a much wider variety of applications.

102
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:22,056
Python 吸引力的关键之处 就在于它的可扩展性
Key to Python's attractiveness was its extensibility.

103
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,387
举个例子 像 ABC 这样的语言 在设计上是固化单一的
A language like ABC, for example, is monolithic in design.

104
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,082
无法形成一个能够真正帮助改善它的社区
There's no way for a real community to help define how the language will work.

105
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:32,559
反观 Python
By contrast,

106
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:32,687
在设计之初 范罗苏姆就希望 Python 是开放的、易于扩展的

107
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:36,799
在设计之初 范罗苏姆就希望 Python 是开放的、易于扩展的
van Rossum wanted Python to be open and extensible from the beginning.

108
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,266
进行软件设计时
When approaching software design,

109
00:06:40,394 --> 00:06:46,900
你往往需要用到一些现有的软件或系统
you often will have to take either existing software or other software systems,

110
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,140
并且要让它们能够协同工作
and get them all to work together,

111
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:55,625
其实软件设计的核心价值之一
and one of the very true values of how you can design software

112
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,009
就在于确保它的可扩展性
is making sure that it's extensible.

113
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:00,111
听起来不怎么费脑子
It sounds like a no-brainer,

114
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:03,967
但并非每一个语言都像 Python 这样
but not every language has achieved the level of extensibility

115
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:06,167
有着与生俱来的强可扩展性
that Python had right from the start.

116
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:10,919
事实上 一门不具备可扩展性的语言
The truth is, if a language doesn't have extensibility baked into it,

117
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,671
大概率会随着自身的发展而崩溃
there's a good chance it will end up collapsing under its own weight as it grows.

118
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:20,743
Python 有一个非常有趣的设计
Python has been designed in a very interesting way

119
00:07:20,743 --> 00:07:25,550
它允许在其核心上进行扩展
that allows it to be extensible at its core.

120
00:07:26,254 --> 00:07:31,646
实际上 你可以在运行时环境上对系统的不同片段打补丁
You can actually patch different pieces of the system at runtime,

121
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:35,600
假如你想要改变模块导入的方式
so if you want to switch out how modules are imported,

122
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,550
或者你想改变你的字符串类型或整数类型
or you want to switch out your string types or your integer types,

123
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,430
Python 允许你用相当容易的方式去实现这些事
Python allows you to do all these things fairly easily.

124
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:48,420
Python 可扩展性的核心
At the heart of Python's extensibility

125
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,915
是所谓的 C 扩展 或者说是 C 模块
is something called C extensions, or C modules.

126
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:59,773
因此 Python 在设计上就为你提供了对其它语言的切入点
So Python has actually been designed to give you an entry point to other languages,

127
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:06,463
本质上来讲 如果你可以写出 C 扩展或 C 模块
and essentially, if you can write a C extension or a C module

128
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:10,326
可以用它去桥接其它数百种语言
that can then bridge to hundreds of other languages,

129
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:14,110
你可以黑入 Python
you can kind of hack Python.

130
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:20,443
这完全取决于用户根据自身需求调整语言的能力
It's all about the user's ability to adapt the language to their own needs.

131
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,635
所以说 Python 按照吉多·范罗苏姆的设想
So Python, as Guido van Rossum envisioned it,

132
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:27,363
绝不会局限于独裁者的个人视野
was never going to be limited to one dictator's vision.

133
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,475
他的“权力交接”备忘是必然要到来的
His “Transfer of Power” memo was a long-time coming.

134
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:35,253
范罗苏姆明白社区影响力所能产生的力量
Van Rossum understood the power of community influence,

135
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:38,428
这是一种能够使所有人都聚集于同一顶“大帐篷”之下的力量
the power of bringing everyone under a big tent.

136
00:08:38,903 --> 00:08:41,019
没错 他最终被冠以独裁者称号
Yes, he ended up getting called a dictator,

137
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,339
但却是一名仁慈的独裁者
but it was benevolent dictator.

138
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:49,336
我认为 Python 社区变得如此多元化
I think one of the reasons why Python has become such a diverse community

139
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:51,446
原因之一就是吉多本人
is because of Guido.

140
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:55,050
Python 现在能够拥有女性核心开发者
Python has female core developers now

141
00:08:55,434 --> 00:09:00,826
正是因为吉多希望有这样的改变 并一手推动其实现
because Guido wanted that change to be made, and made it happen himself.

142
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:05,450
Python 软件基金会的主席 Naomi Ceder
Naomi Ceder, the chair of the Python Software Foundation,

143
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:07,738
曾在一次演讲中说：
once gave a keynote where she said,

144
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,322
“你为语言本身而选择 Python 但留住你的会是社区”
"Python. Come for the language, and stay for the community."

145
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:15,434
这可能正是吉多·范罗苏姆留下的最棒的礼物
And that may be Guido van Rossum's greatest legacy.

146
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:17,000
不仅仅是 Python 语言
Not just Python,

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,610
他更是为整个 Python 社区都创造了空间
but the Python community he made room for.

148
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:22,698
他不仅在语法意义上为 Python 提供了可扩展性
He made Python seriously extensible,

149
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:26,511
某种角度来讲 他也在社交意义上提供了扩展性
but it was, in a way, socially extensible, too.

150
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,450
永远都为新来者留有位置
It always had room for human additions.

151
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:35,290
Python 有着大量不同的应用领域
You have so many different applications of Python that

152
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:42,218
而社区又如此多元化
that your community is then, by definition, and by construct, very diverse.

153
00:09:42,628 --> 00:09:48,775
所以它真的、真的扩展了社区的边界
So it's really, really broadened the community reach.

154
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:53,463
Emily Morehouse 是 Python 核心开发者
Emily Morehouse is a core Python developer

155
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:56,087
与 Cuttlesoft 的工程总监
and Director of Engineering at Cuttlesoft.

156
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,738
Python 降世之后 它就开始了前所未有的增长
Once Python hatched, it started to grow like nothing before.

157
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:06,123
我看到一个 Stack Overflow 上的图表
I'm looking at a Stack Overflow chart

158
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:09,258
统计了每门语言被提及的次数
that shows the amount of chatter they get on each language,

159
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:11,590
对应着 Python 的那条线仿佛坐上了火箭
and Python's line is rocketing.

160
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:15,925
2018 年 在 Google 搜索 Python 的人数
In 2018, more people did Google searches for Python

161
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,302
比搜索金·卡戴珊的还多
than for Kim Kardashian.

162
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,900
这门语言如此火热 以至于它加入了“最常用编程语言”头衔的竞争
All that excitement has it jostling for the title of most-used language

163
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,434
它的对手里包括了 Java C 和 C++
against options like Java, C, and C++.

164
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,656
那么 对 Python 的偏爱究竟来源何处呢？
So, what's with all that love, anyway?

165
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,256
为了找到答案 我找到 Michael Kennedy
To find out, I caught up with developer Michael Kennedy,

166
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:34,944
他活跃在 Python 时代精神的中心
who lives at the center of the Python zeitgeist.

167
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,654
他主持着两个专注于 Python 的播客：
Michael hosts not one, but two podcasts devoted to Python.

168
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:42,848
Talk Python to Me 和 Python Bytes
Talk Python to Me, and Python Bytes.

169
00:10:43,104 --> 00:10:45,494
我们会在展示内容里放上对应的链接以便大家查看
We'll throw some links in the show notes so you can check them out.

170
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,406
Michael 将要和我一起讨论 Python 是如何真正迈出大步的
Michael and I got chatting about how Python really hit its stride.

171
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:55,914
如果你看过分析报告或总结报告一类的东西
If you look at the analytics and the surveys and stuff like that,

172
00:10:56,362 --> 00:11:00,634
会发现 2012 年是一个重要拐点
it really seems to be that 2012 is a strong inflection point,

173
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:03,402
而发生在 2012 年左右最具意义的事情莫过于
and the most significant thing that happened around 2012

174
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:08,986
数据科学社区换掉了 R 之类的东西
is the data science community switched away from things like R,

175
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:12,600
开始真正专注于 Python
some other stuff, to really focus on Python.

176
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,979
这件事发生以后 Python 社区就有了更充足的劲头
Ever since that's happened, there's been even more momentum there,

177
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:17,513
也有了更多的机器学习库
more machine learning libraries.

178
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:20,325
像许多流行的机器学习库
A lot of the popular machine learning libraries, for example,

179
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:21,171
都会首先考虑支持 Python
are Python first,

180
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:22,643
此后才会考虑其他语言
and then they'll consider other languages.

181
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:24,833
嗯 我也这么认为
Yeah, that's been my understanding, too.

182
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,900
当我想到 Python 时 我知道它可以被用作 Web 开发
When I think about Python, I know it can be used for web development;

183
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,975
我也认识许多仍然在使用 Python 来写 Web 应用的人
I know a lot of people who still use it to build web apps.

184
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:36,078
但我感到 Python 如今真正的核心更多是在数据科学领域
But I feel like the heart of it nowadays is more in the data science part of things.

185
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,175
你认为是什么导致了这件事情发生？
What do you think led to that happening?

186
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:40,850
为什么数据科学社区抛弃了那些
Why did the data science community leave things,

187
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,383
或者我不应该叫抛弃 而是疏远了 R 之类的工具?
or I can't say leave, but move away from things like R?

188
00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:45,350
对 正是如此
Right, exactly.

189
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,100
从何而来呢？
Where'd that come from?

190
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,402
我认为这种转变中是有两件事在起作用
I think there's two things at play in that transition.

191
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:56,158
其中之一就是 Python 作为一种“真正的” -
One of those things certainly has to do with Python being a real,

192
00:11:56,158 --> 00:11:57,800
所谓的“真正”编程语言
in quotes, "real" programming language,

193
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,186
它既可以写一些简单的东西
in the sense that you can build simple things.

194
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,658
例如构建图形或数据分析工具等等
You can build graphs and data analysis tools and whatnot.

195
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:06,378
它也可以用来构建 Instagram 和 YouTube
But you can also build Instagram and YouTube and all these other ...

196
00:12:06,378 --> 00:12:07,603
以及其他类似的复杂应用…
But you can also build Instagram and YouTube and all these other ...

197
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:08,202
以及其他类似的复杂应用…
But you can also build Instagram and YouTube and all these other ...
Yeah, yeah!
是的

198
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:08,279
Yeah, yeah!
是的

199
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,628
相对于 R … 之类的东西而言
Whereas things like R ...

200
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,109
相对于 R … 之类的东西而言
Whereas things like R ...
Literally.
显而易见

201
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,453
对 这很显而易见
Yeah, literally, quite literally.

202
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:12,512
有很多应用都是由 Python 来编写的
Those are written in Python.

203
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:15,500
所以他们之前在使用一些其它的编程语言时
So there are other languages they were using,

204
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,138
例如 R
like R at the time,

205
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:22,375
它是专精数据科学工作的 科学统计类的编程语言
was sort of scientific, statistics type programming language that did data sciencey stuff.

206
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,827
如果他们想要写一个 Web 应用来展示他们的结果
But if you wanted to go build a web app to show off your results,

207
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:26,807
那么 他们要用什么来实现呢？
well, what are you going to use?

208
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:28,911
Node 或者 Python 还是…
Node or Python or ...

209
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:30,701
这导致他们没办法一直使用 R 这样的语言
You couldn't stick with it.

210
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:31,531
对 说的很好
Yeah, that's a good point.

211
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:34,175
所以说 Python 拥有相当棒的能力 …
So Python has this really nice ability that it ...

212
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,825
它是一种“真正的”编程语言
Basically, it's a real programming language.

213
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:38,501
这是其一
So that's number one.

214
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:44,069
第二点是 Python 十分独特 它被我称为
Number two is, Python is pretty unique in this, what I call ...

215
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:46,693
…全频谱语言
It's a full-spectrum language.

216
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:48,293
我所谓的全频谱的意思是指
What I mean by full spectrum is,

217
00:12:48,997 --> 00:12:52,700
假如我是一名生物学家、天体物理学家或别的什么
I can be a biologist or astrophysicist or something,

218
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,037
当我想要处理一些数据
and I want to explore a little bit of data,

219
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:58,862
想要加载一个 CSV 文件并运行一些指令得到图像时
I want to load up a CSV file and run some commands and get a picture.

220
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:04,574
我无需理解什么是类、静态方法、主函数、无返回值
I don't need to understand classes, static methods, static main void,

221
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:05,868
编译或者链接
compilation, linking.

222
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,326
你不需要像某些编程语言那样
You don't have to go through all the stuff that some programming languages do

223
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:10,290
为了入门而去学会这些
just to get started.

224
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,506
我只用写几行代码 键入指令 程序就可以运行
You can do just a couple lines of code, type a command, and it runs.

225
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:16,658
但是 你也可以用它去搭建像 Instagram 之类的软件
Yet, you can build things like Instagram and so on.

226
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:22,345
它可以成为绝对专业的系统
It can grow into this absolutely professional system that you can use,

227
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:24,100
但是你不会在一开始就被逼迫着
but you're not forced to understand

228
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,675
去理解大型应用的一切深层抽象
all these deep abstractions that are meant for large applications right away.

229
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:28,955
你可以根据自身需要来使用它
You can adopt them as you need it.

230
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:29,825
我说得有道理吗？
Does that make sense?

231
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:31,188
对 对 非常有道理
Yeah, yeah. That makes a lot of sense.

232
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:34,602
刚才我们谈论到 2012 年的拐点时
So we talked about that inflection point around 2012,

233
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:37,875
我搜索了一些关于 Python 的资料
and when I was looking and doing some research about Python,

234
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:42,800
Python 的确是世界上被 Google 次数最多的编程语言
Python is actually one of the world's most Googled, Google searched, coding languages.

235
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,376
哇
Wow.

236
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:46,832
你感觉它现在确实被大家青睐 并且仍在成长之中吗？
Do you feel like it's really picking up and growing at this point?

237
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,120
我认为它真的被青睐并处于成长之中
I do think it's picking up and that it's growing.

238
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,096
在我们谈论到的过去几年里
In those last number of years we talked about,

239
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:57,150
有相当多的企业集团都选择使用 Python
there's certainly more enterprise groups that are using Python.

240
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,678
而他们曾经的选择是 .NET、Java 有时是 C
It used to be .NET, Java, maybe some C.

241
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:03,175
这就是回答 并且现在 Python 开始走出属于自己的路
That was the answer, and now Python is starting to make its way in,

242
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,399
我认为它在某些场景下被格外倚重
and I think it's getting sideloaded into those environments somewhat,

243
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,139
关于这个 我指的是那些数据科学家们
and by that, I mean the data science folks.

244
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:12,200
就像 显然
It's like, well, obviously

245
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,500
我们用到的 Jupyter Lab 和它的 Notebook 之类优秀应用
we're going to use Jupyter Lab and all the cool notebook stuff.

246
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,275
全都是 Python 造就的
That's Python.

247
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:21,300
数据科学没有祖传代码的负担
Data science doesn't have such a legacy code base story.

248
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,456
如果我想开发一个新的项目
If I'm going to start a new project

249
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:27,825
用来分析广告活动或科学结果
where we're exploring some ad campaign or some science results,

250
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,475
它不会对一堆陈旧的东西 保持着庞大的依赖关系
that doesn't have a huge dependency on old stuff.

251
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:32,678
模型和数据都会过时
Models and data expire,

252
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:37,310
因此对于数据科学世界而言 切换技术栈或保持最新状态要容易得多
so it's more easy for the data science world to switch technologies or stay more current.

253
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,752
说得不错
That's a good point.

254
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,264
嗯 谢谢
Yeah, thanks.

255
00:14:39,264 --> 00:14:42,900
嗯 听上去 Python 不会很快停止成长
Yeah. And it sounds like it's not going to stop growing anytime soon.

256
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,775
而是保持增长的趋势
It sounds like it's going to keep growing,

257
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:47,655
甚至这种增长的势头越加迅猛
and the momentum is still going to carry it forward.

258
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,562
你认为对这种增长与前进的势头影响最大的事情是什么呢
What do you think is going to influence that growth the most, moving forward?

259
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:55,027
我感觉这就像滚雪球
I feel like it's this ball rolling downhill.

260
00:14:55,027 --> 00:15:00,147
Python 有如此多我们可以使用的库和软件包
We have all the libraries and packages you can use with Python.

261
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:04,490
现在更是多到难以置信
It's a ridiculous number that we have now.

262
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:06,726
一两年前 这个数字大概是 10 万
A year or two ago, it was 100,000.

263
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:08,603
而现在我们已经有了 17 万个包或项目
Now it's 170,000 packages or projects.

264
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:09,053
而现在我们已经有了 17 万个包或项目
Now it's 170,000 packages or projects.
Wow.
哇

265
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:10,350
而现在我们已经有了 17 万个包或项目
Now it's 170,000 packages or projects.

266
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,526
你可以仅仅写几行代码
You can just, in a couple lines of code,

267
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:14,150
然后说 噢 我要做机器学习
oh, I'd like to do machine learning.

268
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:17,324
有人在会议上向我们展示了一个例子
Someone at the conference showed us an example of,

269
00:15:17,324 --> 00:15:19,995
他们训练一个机器学习系统
here's how we're going to train a machine learning system

270
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:23,707
给它提供大量人脸的图像
to be given a bunch of faces of people,

271
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,949
并告诉系统他们拥有什么类型的眼睛
choose what type of eyes they have.

272
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:28,333
是圆眼睛？或者椭圆形眼睛之类的东西
Do they have round eyes, do they have oval eyes, things like that.

273
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,597
似乎这会帮助你决定妆容之类的
Apparently this drives the kind of makeup you have or something.

274
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,047
噢 哇
Oh, wow.

275
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,093
这位女士的演讲十分精彩 然后她说
This woman did a great presentation, and she said,

276
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:35,781
这是训练模型的代码 让大家提问
here's the code to train this model,

277
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:36,075
这是训练模型的代码 让大家提问

278
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:37,500
这是训练模型的代码 让大家提问
and then to ask it questions.

279
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,393
而代码从头到尾只有十五行
And it was 15 lines of code from beginning to end.

280
00:15:40,393 --> 00:15:40,895
接着你看 就像她说的那样
And then you have, here's your thing that tells you,
Wow.
哇

281
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:42,314
接着你看 就像她说的那样
And then you have, here's your thing that tells you,

282
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,150
你提供一张照片 模型就会知道你的眼睛像什么
given a picture, what your eyes are like.

283
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,918
噢 天哪
Oh my goodness.

284
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:46,646
这种类型的项目势头十足
The momentum of those types of things,

285
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,820
这些简洁 但功能极为强大的东西
these little, super powerful things,

286
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,375
你可以直接通过一些包来导入 这真是厉害极了
you can just bring in through these packages is ridiculous.

287
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,660
你可以直接通过一些包来导入 这真是厉害极了
you can just bring in through these packages is ridiculous.
Wow, that's so cool.
哇 这好酷

288
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,678
Wow, that's so cool.
哇 这好酷

289
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:53,842
是不是很疯狂
Ain't that crazy?
Wow, that's so cool.
哇 这好酷

290
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:54,660
是不是很疯狂
Ain't that crazy?

291
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,132
好吧 让我们暂停一下对话
Okay. Let's pause that conversation for a sec.

292
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,208
我们会在稍后听到更多 Michael 的观点
We're going to hear more from Michael later on,

293
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,336
但我现在想要回头来强调一些事情
but I want to go back and underline something.

294
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:09,395
使 Python 这些令人惊叹的特质成为可能的源头
It's what makes all those amazing Python qualities possible in the first place.

295
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,503
Python 社区
The Python community.

296
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,564
Python 成功的一个决定性因素就是这个庞大的、反应迅速的社区
A defining part of Python's success is that huge, responsive community.

297
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:24,412
此时此刻 正如我们在范罗苏姆离开时看到的那样
At the same time, as we saw with van Rossum's departure,

298
00:16:24,604 --> 00:16:27,292
社区的规模已经庞大到让人难以接受
the size of that community can be overwhelming.

299
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:32,968
想象一下你不得不背着整个语言包袱的样子
Imagine having to carry the hangups of an entire language around with you.

300
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,354
某种角度来说 吸引了如此庞大的社区
In a way, attracting such a massive community

301
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:40,386
让保有一个终生独裁者的主意变得站不住脚
made the idea of a single dictator for life just untenable.

302
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:44,577
范罗苏姆恐怕未曾设想
Van Rossum wasn't necessarily prepared

303
00:16:44,577 --> 00:16:48,161
他的语言会收到如此巨大的反响
for how huge a response his language was going to receive,

304
00:16:48,545 --> 00:16:50,401
但是 几乎完全自发地
but, almost organically,

305
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:53,793
社区成员将 Python 的邮件列表
community members pulled together Python's mailing list,

306
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:55,916
新闻组、网站
its newsgroup, its website,

307
00:16:56,172 --> 00:17:01,436
以及最终通过 PEP 讨论语言变化的流程汇集在一起
and eventually, the process for discussing language changes via PEPs.

308
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,016
PEP 是“Python 改良提案”的缩写
That stands for Python Enhancement Proposals.

309
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,612
所以 尽管有着独裁者的名号
So, despite the dictator title,

310
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:11,452
范罗苏姆仍致力于搭建一个用户可以真正传达意见、
van Rossum was building a language that you could really talk back to,

311
00:17:11,836 --> 00:17:14,304
参与其建设的语言
a language that users could help build.

312
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:18,792
我敢打赌 尽管他在离开的那一刻感到沮丧
I'm betting that despite his frustration at that moment of departure,

313
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:21,988
但范罗苏姆明白 一个活跃的社区
van Rossum knew that a dynamic community

314
00:17:21,988 --> 00:17:25,300
给他的语言带去的好处 要远胜他离去而折损的
would give more to his language than it could ever take away.

315
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,863
我叫 Diane Mueller
My name is Diane Mueller.

316
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:32,127
Diane 是红帽云平台的社区开发总监
Diane's the Director of Community Development at Red Hat for the cloud platform.

317
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:34,360
在过去的 30 年里
Over the past 30 years,

318
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,175
她目睹了开源社区的强劲发展
she's witnessed a powerful evolution in the strength of open source communities,

319
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:42,631
尤其是 Python 社区 给她留下了极为深刻的印象
and she's been impressed by Python's community in particular.

320
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:46,151
Python 社区做得太棒了…
The Python community has done amazing ...

321
00:17:46,471 --> 00:17:50,071
他们带来了大量行为准则的概念 比如说 关于会议
They brought in the concept of codes of conduct for conferences,

322
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:53,550
多样性奖金 各种各样的东西
diversity scholarships, all of that sort of stuff.

323
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,200
通过引入不同的声音以及不同的观点
By bringing in the different voices and the different perspectives,

324
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,900
我们得到了一个更好、更具创新性的项目
we get a better and more innovative project

325
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,525
它必定能够留存得更久
that will live on longer,

326
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:03,250
并有望为更多的人带去更好的体验
and hopefully work better for more people.

327
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:05,581
即便他们犯错了
Even the mistakes they made,

328
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:12,575
也会开诚布公的进行处理
they handled openly and transparently and through collaboration with the community

329
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:15,462
以前 我在别处见过这种精神的消磨殆尽
after seeing that sort of spirit wither away

330
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:18,684
它萎缩了 让位于硅谷创业公司中的“兄弟”文化
into a bro culture from Silicon Valley and startups,
“兄弟”文化 (Bro Culture)：这种现象被认为是一种工作场所中广泛存在的不良文化
对于女性 它表现为大男子主义 对于男性 它表现为一系列的规训 要求他们与特定的气质相吻合

331
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,716
Python 就像带我回到了我创业的地方
Python felt like coming back home to the roots of where I got started,

332
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:28,219
围绕着它的社区也像是回到了往日
and the community that had been around back in the day.

333
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,178
它真的相当鼓舞人心 非常惊艳
So it was pretty inspiring and pretty awesome.

334
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:38,112
能够鼓舞如此多的人 是因为 Python 在最初就重新定义了
Inspiring largely because Python redefined what it means

335
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:40,259
成为社区一员的含义
to be part of the community in the first place.

336
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:44,523
我讲过吉多·范罗苏姆即使是在引退之际
I mentioned that Guido van Rossum started championing women in the community,

337
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:46,379
仍倡导了在社区里对女性的拥护
even as he stepped down.

338
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:50,550
此外他也在更宽泛的意义上帮助了社区的拓展
But he also helped widen the tent in a more general way.

339
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,774
个人为集体带来的远远不止是代码贡献
Individuals bring a lot more to the table than just code contributions.

340
00:18:54,774 --> 00:18:57,734
绝大多数社区管理者或是项目主管
Mostly community managers and project leads

341
00:18:57,734 --> 00:19:01,334
都把精力集中在如何促进大家为他们的项目做出贡献
focus on trying to get people to contribute to their project,

342
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:03,676
而在 Python 社区里
and in the Python community,

343
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:08,400
大家会鼓励你参与文档工作
people were really highly encouraging you to work on documentation,

344
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,025
或是帮助会议的举办
to help run the conferences,

345
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,600
以及对多样性的促进
to help promote diversity.

346
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,416
这里有许多不同类型的事让你参与
There were all sorts of other things you could do

347
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,525
都可以使你成为 Python 社区的一份子
to be part of the Python community.

348
00:19:19,037 --> 00:19:24,575
所以这个想法 即社区贡献不仅仅局限于代码
So that idea, that contribution isn't just about code,

349
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:28,671
像参与活动、相互学习和教育
it's about participation, it's about learning and education,

350
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:31,175
以及大量的文档工作
and it's a lot about documentation,

351
00:19:31,175 --> 00:19:34,032
这些对许多人而言都是融入 Python 社区的方法
was the way into community for a lot of people.

352
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,325
当然 我们还有许多路要走
Of course, we've still got a ways to go.

353
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:40,394
用人制度仍然注重于技术
Meritocracy is still very technically focused.

354
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:41,875
没人会怀疑这个
No one's going to doubt that.

355
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:47,011
但我想你也看见社区管理和社区管理者的理念了…
But I think you also see the belief that community management and community managers ...

356
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:49,275
我们也是社区重要的一份子
We're skilled parts of a community,

357
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:53,563
不只是被雇来组织活动的
as opposed to just the person we hired to create our events for us.

358
00:19:54,971 --> 00:20:00,363
对 Diane 而言 范罗苏姆正式放弃他独裁者角色的决定
For Diane, van Rossum's decision to officially abdicate his dictator role

359
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:02,350
是全局变化的一部分
is part of a global shift.

360
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:06,654
这代表着编程语言的建设开始摆脱陈旧与单一
It's moving away from older, monolithic kinds of language-building.

361
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,875
我想我们可能已经摆脱了这种模式
I think we might have moved on from that model,

362
00:20:11,425 --> 00:20:13,500
尽管每过一段时间 我就会听人说
though every once in a while, I hear someone say,

363
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,596
“是的 我终生都是这个项目的仁慈独裁者 ”
yeah, I'm the benevolent dictator for life of this project,

364
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:18,475
但我并不认同
and I'm like, yeah, I don't think so.

365
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:24,891
Diane Mueller 是红帽社区发展总监
Diane Mueller is a Director of Community Development at Red Hat.

366
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:33,431
在吉多·范罗苏姆发出那份令人瞠目结舌的《权力交接》之后
By the time Guido van Rossum sent that jaw-dropping “Transfer of Power” memo,

367
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:36,967
Python 社区自身便成为了权力中心
the Python community was a powerhouse unto itself.

368
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:41,719
随着项目的成熟发展 出现新的治理模式是正常的
It's common for projects to adopt new governance models as they grow,

369
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:43,925
并且正如我们所见
and in many ways, as we've seen,

370
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:47,825
这些人已经做好准备 要来管理自己的语言了
these folks were ready to take charge of their own language.

371
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:52,049
但我仍然好奇 整件事最终是如何收场的？
But I still want to know, how exactly did that pan out?

372
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:54,820
范罗苏姆退场之后究竟发生了什么
What happened after van Rossum stepped away.

373
00:20:55,396 --> 00:20:59,500
让我们回到与 Michael Kennedy 的对话中来找到答案吧
Let's go back to our conversation with Michael Kennedy to get some answers.

374
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,500
…他离开了 Python 社区在没有他的情况下过得怎么样呢？
... back and away from Python, how has the community been doing without him?

375
00:21:05,475 --> 00:21:07,575
嗯 社区的状态其实还不错
Well, the community has been okay,

376
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:11,815
但我们的上层…有点卡住了
but we've been in ... at the highest level, kind of a stasis.

377
00:21:12,455 --> 00:21:19,071
运行时和语言基本上陷入了停滞
The runtime and the language just basically had to go into a coma.

378
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:23,615
有一些有趣的提案 有些比较麻烦
There were proposals for interesting things, and they were sometimes complicated,

379
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:25,300
有些又挺简单
but sometimes really simple.

380
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,576
比如 嘿 要不然我们每一年发布一次 Python
Like, hey, wouldn't it be great if we could ship Python yearly instead of every 18 months,

381
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:28,825
而不是每 18 个月
Like, hey, wouldn't it be great if we could ship Python yearly instead of every 18 months,

382
00:21:28,825 --> 00:21:32,500
这样跟年度会议绑在一起 语言变化会变得更可预测 就类似这种事
so it's a little more predictable, tied around the yearly conference, things like that.

383
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,041
这样跟年度会议绑在一起 语言变化会变得更可预测 就类似这种事
so it's a little more predictable, tied around the yearly conference, things like that.
Sure, yeah.
是啊 嗯

384
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:33,396
Sure, yeah.
是啊 嗯

385
00:21:33,396 --> 00:21:34,568
这些都是无法做出定夺的
That couldn't be decided,

386
00:21:34,568 --> 00:21:37,176
因为在他引退之后 还没有方法去做决策
because there was no way to make decisions after he stepped down.

387
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:39,688
他基本上只留下一句 我去度假了
He basically said, I'm going to go on vacation.

388
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:43,157
全靠你们了 你们自己搞明白怎么继续运行下去
This is up to you guys, you have to figure out how to keep running this.

389
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,725
我不会告诉你们怎样去做决策或怎么去运营
I'm not even going to tell you how to decide how to keep running it.

390
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,624
这些麻烦现在是你们的了
This is your problem now.

391
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,180
这听起来非常有戏剧性
That sounds dramatic,

392
00:21:51,564 --> 00:21:52,376
但仔细一想
but check this out.

393
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:55,464
还记得之前提到的 Python 改良提案（PEP）吗？
Remember those Python Enhancement Proposals,

394
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,354
那些用于接受社区反馈的 PEP？
the PEPs that allowed the community to give feedback?

395
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,248
它们可以拯救大伙
Well, PEPs to the rescue.

396
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,202
有一系列提案试图为 Python 社区确立新的治理模型
There was a series of them

397
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:06,975
有一系列提案试图为 Python 社区确立新的治理模型
trying to determine new governance models for the Python community.

398
00:22:06,975 --> 00:22:11,599
最大的新闻是他们最终决定选择其中之一
Well, the big news is they've decided on one of those,

399
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:14,415
叫做“指导委员会” 有五名成员
called the Steering Council, which is five people

400
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:15,675
我确信五人的投票权是相等的
- I believe they all have equal votes -

401
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:19,654
他们最近选举出了五个人
and they've recently elected those five.

402
00:22:19,846 --> 00:22:22,769
所以 这不是一个人的责任 而是所有人的责任
So instead of it being on one person's shoulders, it's on all of them.

403
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,625
我感到十分高兴的一件事是
One thing that I think is really nice is that

404
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,929
吉多·范罗苏姆也是他们的一员
we have Guido van Rossum as one of those members.
注：吉多于2019年被选举为委员会成员 但在2020年的选举中放弃了提名
他在帖子中提到 自己无意再担任委员会成员 因为感到这份职责是一件“苦差事”（chore）

405
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:32,675
他引退后说 “我不能作为…”
He stepped away and said, I cannot be the single source of ...

406
00:22:32,675 --> 00:22:36,131
“所有人想要改变和反馈的压力的唯一的发泄口”
all the pressure of people wanting changes and feedback.

407
00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:39,475
但是他还在 他没有完全抛弃这门语言
But he still, he didn't completely run away from the language.

408
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:41,650
他仍然是一个核心开发者 并且加入了指导委员会
He's still a core developer, and he's on the Steering Council.

409
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:46,187
因此他仍然保留了发言权 但无需再独自承受一切
So he still has some say, but he doesn't have to take it on entirely,

410
00:22:46,187 --> 00:22:46,990
这真是非常棒
which is pretty cool.

411
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,104
我很好奇 这一切在现实世界里是怎么奏效的
I'm wondering how that works out in reality,

412
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:52,353
我感觉如果我是指导委员会的一员
because I feel like if I'm on the Steering Council

413
00:22:52,353 --> 00:22:56,321
和语言的创造者坐在一起
and I'm sitting next to the creator of the language,

414
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,548
我可能会倾向于赞同他所说的任何意见
I'd probably tend to agree with whatever he says.

415
00:22:58,548 --> 00:23:02,500
对 确实如此 在平局的情况下 最终取决于吉多
Right, exactly. All things being equal, ties go to Guido.

416
00:23:03,268 --> 00:23:04,750
对 是这样
Yeah, exactly.

417
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,700
我不确定 但我认识指导委员会的一些人
I don't know. I do know some of the people on the Steering Council,

418
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,675
他们一直以来都是社区的贡献者和开发者
and they've been constant contributors and developers,

419
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:16,319
可能超过了…在代码的意义上
maybe even to ... at a code level,

420
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,879
十五年来给 Python 写的代码比吉多本人写的还多
more so than Guido for 15 years.

421
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,654
他们也都是非常深入的参与者 并且相当有主见-
So they're also pretty deeply involved and pretty opinionated, so-

422
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:24,550
…而且相当投入
And invested.

423
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,050
对 投入巨大
Yeah, certainly invested.

424
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,290
所以我认为这是行之有效的
So I feel like it's going to be okay.

425
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:32,975
另外 我觉得吉多的态度是 我仍然想参与其中
Also, I feel like Guido's probably like, I still want to be involved,

426
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:37,650
但不愿把自己的意志强加于人
but he's probably done trying to impose his will on people,

427
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,450
否则一切都和原先没什么两样…
because that will just put him right back into the same ...

428
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,900
我认为他可能倾向于呆在压力没那么大的位置上
I think he's probably going to take a more relaxed position.

429
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,756
好的 我想知道
Okay. I'm wondering,

430
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:49,044
你会不会觉得“仁慈的终生独裁者”这种模式
do you feel like this model of having a benevolent dictator for life,

431
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:54,045
在一门语言的初创阶段 是必须的？
is that model almost required at the beginning of a language,

432
00:23:54,045 --> 00:23:55,806
是不是这样才能让项目启动运行
in order to get it up and running,

433
00:23:55,806 --> 00:23:59,534
才能让它能拥有激进的设计 获得革命性的优势？
in order for it to be radical and have these breakthrough advances?

434
00:23:59,829 --> 00:23:59,854
我认同 我认为 大多数由委员会进行的设计 并不惊艳

435
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:05,013
我认同 我认为 大多数由委员会进行的设计 并不惊艳
I do. I think stuff, mostly design by committee, is not super.

436
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:05,038
I do. I think stuff, mostly design by committee, is not super.

437
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:09,634
在早期 有太多决策需要进行
So in the early days, so many decisions about,

438
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:11,100
语言如何工作？
how does the language work?

439
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,206
要不要用分号？
Does it use semicolons?

440
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:13,584
怎么做这 怎么做那？
How does it do this, does it do that?

441
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:18,020
所有这些内容都很难由委员会来决定
All that stuff is really hard to committee decide,

442
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:21,535
但是 Python 至今已经有 25 年的历史了
but Python is over 25 years old now.

443
00:24:21,535 --> 00:24:25,439
它有这么多人参与其中
It's got so many people involved in it.

444
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:28,831
我认为现在 它遵循的是一个非常好的模式
I think now, that this is a pretty good model.

445
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:32,184
他们还有过辩论 是否应该换上一个替补的 BDFL
They also debated whether or not there should just be a replacement BDFL,

446
00:24:32,568 --> 00:24:34,936
我们选谁当国王呢？
who do we elect now to be our king?

447
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,214
不过 他们最后没有采取这个提议
They decided against that, though.

448
00:24:37,406 --> 00:24:41,625
好 如果 BDFL 的位置有这么重要
Okay. If that BDFL position is so important,

449
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:45,250
我想知道 社区需要依赖他多久呢？
I'm wondering, how long does a community need one?

450
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,642
听上去吉多是自行做出决定：嘿 太过分了
It sounds like Guido decided on his own, hey, this is too much.

451
00:24:48,642 --> 00:24:51,600
这样下去不行 我不干了
This is not sustainable anymore, I'm not doing this anymore.

452
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,160
但是 假如他没有做出这样的决策 我想知道
But if it wasn't his decision, I'm wondering,

453
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,209
是否有一个最佳的时机让这个人退出
is there an optimal time where that person should step down

454
00:24:58,209 --> 00:25:00,897
让大家走向一个更民主的状态呢？
and we should move to something a little bit more democratic?

455
00:25:01,425 --> 00:25:03,217
嗯 一定会有的 对吧？
Yeah, there has to be, right?

456
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:05,329
我认为这个时机应该存在
I think that there probably is.

457
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,006
一个人难以
It's hard for one person to

458
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:12,450
与社区、技术的脉搏以及新的趋势一直保持紧密联系
still be completely connected with the pulse of the community

459
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,234
与社区、技术的脉搏以及新的趋势一直保持紧密联系
and technology and the new trends,

460
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,527
说个数 大概 40 年
let's say, 40 years out.

461
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,034
这是件极其困难的事
That would be super difficult,

462
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:20,210
因此一定要有这个转换
so there's got to be this switchover.

463
00:25:20,578 --> 00:25:22,275
我不能确切的说究竟在什么时候
I don't really know where it is,

464
00:25:22,275 --> 00:25:26,684
但我认为必须得等到其他人
but I feel like it's got to be after you have other people

465
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:29,180
相比 BDFL 做出了更多的贡献
doing more work than the BDFL is doing.

466
00:25:30,726 --> 00:25:34,950
随着核心贡献者和开发者越来越多 然后你就 嗯 我要去度假了
More core contributors and developers, and you're just like, well, I was on vacation,

467
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,734
看看这些新的事情发生了 它还能活下来
and look at all these new things that happened, and it survived.

468
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:39,142
类似这样的事情
Something to that effect.

469
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,986
嗯 就好像是社区在准备好后会自己告诉你
Yeah. It's almost like the community will tell you when it's ready.

470
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:43,202
对 正是如此
Right, exactly.

471
00:25:48,528 --> 00:25:51,943
Python 社区的生涯仍将继续
The Python community is still taking on a life of its own,

472
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,576
这里就是我们暂时告一段落的地方
so that's where we'll leave them for now.

473
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:57,728
Michael Kennedy 的两个播客
Michael Kennedy is the host of two podcasts

474
00:25:57,728 --> 00:26:00,544
会持续追踪 Python 之后的历程
that'll keep on tracking their progression in the meantime.

475
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:04,512
欢迎订阅 Talk Python to Me 和 Python Bytes
You can check out Talk Python to Me and Python Bytes.

476
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,960
你听说过被称为古代雅典立法者的梭伦的故事吗？
Have you ever heard the story of Solon, the guy known as the lawgiver of ancient Athens?

477
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,865
他是个很酷的家伙
Pretty cool guy.

478
00:26:14,249 --> 00:26:18,233
在梭伦为雅典的民主制度建立宪法之后
After Solon established a constitution for Athenian democracy,

479
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:21,513
他选择了流放他自己
he went off into a state of voluntary exile.

480
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:26,999
因为他清楚 继续执政只会增加他成为暴君的风险
That's because he knew there was a danger he'd become a tyrant if he stayed in power.

481
00:26:27,575 --> 00:26:30,903
我觉得吉多·范罗苏姆就像是当代梭伦
I guess Guido van Rossum is a latter day Solon,

482
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,716
为我们提供了数十年的标准实践
giving us decades of standard practice,

483
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:35,900
有点像是一部宪法
which is a bit like a constitution.

484
00:26:36,348 --> 00:26:39,628
他建立起一门出色的编程语言
Here's a guy who set up a brilliant programming language,

485
00:26:39,756 --> 00:26:43,916
一个能真正由开源社区自己运作的语言
a language where an open source community could really make it their own.

486
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:48,844
然后 他给予他们一个权力转移的时刻
Then, he also gave them that transfer of power moment,

487
00:26:48,844 --> 00:26:51,020
他在那时告诉他们 全靠你们自己
where he told them, you're on your own.

488
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:53,287
我不再是你们的独裁者了
I'm no longer your dictator.

489
00:26:54,604 --> 00:26:58,308
他确保了一定是由社区 而非他本人
He made sure that it had to be the community, not himself,

490
00:26:58,436 --> 00:27:00,436
来推动 Python 前行
that carried the Python mantle forward.

491
00:27:01,128 --> 00:27:04,648
某种意义上 吉多·范罗苏姆的“权力交接”
In a way, Guido van Rossum's “Transfer of Power” memo

492
00:27:04,648 --> 00:27:08,888
是开源世界中所有编程语言的共同宣言
is a manifesto for all programming languages in an open source world,

493
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:11,960
因为任何语言随着其社区的发展
because as any language grows its community,

494
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,184
终将面临唯有社区才可以解决的挑战
it ends up taking on challenges that only the community can solve.

495
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,757
在《代码英雄》的第三季中
In season 3 of Command Line Heroes,

496
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:25,330
我们会对编程语言的世界进行深入的挖掘
we're doing a deep dive into the world of programming languages.

497
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:27,025
一门编程语言之所以能获得影响力
Languages gain influence

498
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:30,650
正因为它是解决新问题的利器
because they solve a new problem in some powerful new way,

499
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,374
在本季的剩余时间里
and for the rest of the season,

500
00:27:32,502 --> 00:27:34,865
我们会探索
