When I started out doing software development, I was mostly just making little
在我刚开始做软件开发的时候 我基本上只做些让自己开心的小项目

projects that amused me, little apps, little command-line tools, and stuff like that.
像小应用程序 命令行小工具之类的

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,400
I just really didn't know that it was so easy to contribute
我只是真的不知道作出贡献那么容易

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,300
and that you don't need to have solved P=NP,
而且你不需要解决 P = NP 那样的难题

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,660
your input can still be valuable.
你的投入依然可以是很有价值的

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,920
Local communities made me confident enough to contribute.
本地社区使我有了足够的信心去做出贡献

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,820
When I was a total newbie to programming, I teamed up with my friend Dan
当我还完全是个编程新手的时候 我和我的朋友 Dan 一起

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,540
to make my very first open source pull request (PR)

which would also make it my very first open source contribution
这也是我的第一次开源贡献

10
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,920
I'd heard so much about contributing to open source, about how amazing it was,
我听过很多为开源做贡献的故事 说它有多么神奇

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,100
but also how completely terrifying. I was very aware,
又有多么可怕 我很清楚

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,060
not all communities are kind and not all maintainers are nice.
并非所有社区都和善 也不是所有维护者都很友好

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,480
The project itself was a pretty good one for a first timer.
那个项目本身对新手来说相当不错

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,820
We were just adding a JavaScript library,

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,300
something to let people get a digital walkthrough of the website.
让人们可以在线预览网站

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,540
Just a nice well–scoped project. Self–contained.
这是一个很好的适用范围很广 自成体系的项目

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,520
Bonus, if the thing didn't work,
而且如果这玩意儿不起作用

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,660
I was almost positive it wouldn't burn down the whole site.
我基本上确信它不会毁掉整个网站

19
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,920
Yet, I was crazy nervous about this pull request.
然而 我对这个 PR 非常紧张

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,320
Dan and I read the docs for the library,

21

plugged away at our code.
埋头于写我们的代码

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,040
I still remember when we were finally done, we just looked at each other
我仍记得当我们最终完成的时候 只是互相看着彼此

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
like, "That's it?"
好像在说：“就这样吗？”

and I guess I was surprised by how,

I don't know, how mechanical it all was.
这一切 都这么机械化么？

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,960
It wasn't some big mystery or magical thing that only they could do.
这并不是什么只有他们才能做到的 也不是什么神秘或神奇的事情

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
I realized, I really could contribute, too.
我意识到我确实也可以对开源作出贡献

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,320
That's a bit of knowledge we're passing on in this episode;

30
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,940
making a contribution to open source isn't magic.

We're going to walk through this together.

就是要让世界多一点同情心 以及包容健康多元文化

62

There are many barriers to entry as we see them,

63
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,260
but we like to call them "no good reasons."
但我们喜欢称它们为“没有充分的理由”

有三个这样的壁垒将女性专门排斥在技术之外

65
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,480
They are: stereotypes, they're the accessibility, and the environment.
它们是：刻板印象、可及性和环境

66
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,000
It's worth remembering here promoting diversity doesn't just make good ethical sense,
值得记住的是 促进多元化不仅具有良好的道德意义

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
it makes good business sense, too.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,980
Technology as an industry has probably the greatest potential

contributing to open source projects.

The fact is, we didn't all start with the same advantages or experiences.
事实是 我们并非一开始就拥有同样的优势和经验

75
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,920

下一代的伟大开发者可能看上去并不像硅谷的程序员

76
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:29,460

再者 我认为从 2014 年至今 情况有所改善

Speaking of newbies, back to that contributor we were tracking.
说到新手 回到我们正在追踪的那个贡献者

85
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,960
When you're not from a mainstream background,
倘若你不是来自主流背景时

86
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,040
that first commit can carry a lot of weight.

It can feel like you have to prove yourself.

88
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,460
Once we get those barriers to entry low enough,
不过一旦我们将加入的壁垒降得足够低

89
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,060
what do we actually need to think about as we prepare to contribute?
我们在准备做出贡献时 实际需要考虑的是什么呢

Find that niche where you and the project make sense together.
找到对你和项目都有意义的利益基础

95
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,940
I think a project to contribute to usually comes out of
我认为一个可让人持续贡献的项目

96
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,860
a reciprocal relationship.

它满足了你的一个需求 而且在这个过程中你又发现了

98
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,540
to satisfy a need for it, and it becomes a relationship,
满足它的需求的方式 即使它是一个由人构成的社区

99
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,060
even if it is a community of people.
它也已经成为了一种共生体系

100
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,520
For example:

get it packaged for the mainstream Slackware Linux community.
将其打包到了主流 Slackware Linux 社区

104

并最终成为了这个项目的贡献者和维护者

105
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,420
not because I sought out to be a contributor to that Slackware Linux community,
这并不是因为我想成为 Slackware Linux 社区的贡献者

106
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,900
but it most well suited
而是因为这是最适合我的一个项目

107
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,480
the other project, the use case that I was actually trying to solve.
它的用例正好是我一直致力于解决的事情

108
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,320
I think that happens a lot for a lot of folks. They seek to write a database because
我想很多人都会遇到这种情况 他们因自己量身定制的用例

109
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,740
of their tailored use case, and they find that it works well in Golang,
而编写一个数据库软件 他们发现用 Golang 编写很合适

113
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,780
The key point is, start somewhere.
关键在于 从某处开始去做

114
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,420
You don't have to wait for a degree or for absolute confidence.

一些人 甚至是一个没有薪酬的社区成员

123

负责去检查 Web 服务器是否停机或出了什么问题 这也算是积累经验

silence, that's a fun one,

她还不知道要求修改是个实际上是成功的一步

她甚至还对维护者的简略语气感到一点气愤

158
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,080

part of his pain was coming from the fact that he knows the contributors honestly care, too.
他的部分痛苦来自于 他清楚贡献者也同样很在意这个项目

176

总体来说 IT、 CS（计算机科学）事实上都是如此

I think having corporate involvement like that gives

stability to some of the roles

我们研究的一个问题是确保领袖角色的漂亮退场

222
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,020
where you say you sign up for something, it's not necessarily a lifetime commitment.
所谓的职位并不一定是终身的委任

223
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,260

you can gracefully go on without feeling like you're letting people down.

230
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,180
It's almost like a family rather than something like a workplace or something like that.
社区几乎就像一个家庭 而不是工作场所之类的东西

231
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,680
It's meaningful to contribute to
在这里做出贡献很有意义

232
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,100
because you're working on this not just for yourself, or not just for some
因为你不仅只在为自己或是某些

233
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,600
paycheck or an end product, but because the people you're working on it with are your friends and
薪酬或终端产品工作 而且由于共事的是你的朋友

t's something that you're working on together to make something that's bigger than this individual effort.
你们一起工作能做出比单人作品更伟大的东西

235
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,000
Whether it's thanks to Fedora or something else,

a world where open source contributions are sustainable,

There's one last piece of the story—

like GitHub and GitLab,

places where we can all come together.

我想深入探讨一下这些社区是如何使我们的工作成为可能的

I got chatting with Shannon Crabill about it.

Thinking back to that point in October,
回想起十月那时候

I think the hardest part is getting used to the motions of
我认为最困难的部分 在于习惯工作流程

266

just how it works and practicing. How do I push repo? How do I share a project?
并付诸实践 如何推送存储库？如何分享项目？

你必须和他们交谈 审查他们的代码并发表意见

merged my own code into my own code,

so I had to figure that out.

Merge complex in general

291

That's a really good one.
好问题 我认为

would maybe be a hindrance.

I think I was lucky that I didn't think that

303
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,660
when I went into this, so I was able to go into it like,
进入这个领域的时候 我没有这样想 所以我能

说实话 如果它们崩溃了 我真不知道该如何修复

我可能会看着代码然后想道 “是的 它崩溃了”

311
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,460

their experiences to the table with to do.

README 文件里还可以做很多事情 归根结底
